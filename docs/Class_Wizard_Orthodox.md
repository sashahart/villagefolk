## Orthodox Wizard

**Perk: **You start with red robes. 

**Drawback:** None. 

**Cantrips**

1. Change the colour or texture of an object no larger than a horse for 10 minutes.
2. Create a tiny light as bright as a match on your fingertip. 
3. Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll along the ground or turn the pages of a book, but you couldn't open a door or lift a stone. 

Having no drawback is a rarity, even if your perks and cantrips aren't very impressive. They are good classic *orthodox* cantrips. 

### Orthodox Wizard Main Spell List

An Orthodox Wizard can roll on the** **[**100 Orthodox Spell List** ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/03/osr-100-orthodox-spells.html)instead of rolling on the list below. Results may vary.

**1. Lock**

**R**: 50' **T**: [dice] creatures or objects **D**: 10 minutes 

Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door, chest, or similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing through it and then trapping them. This spell works on things that aren't technically portals (for example, a sword could be locked in its scabbard.) Requires Str 10 + [dice]x4 to open. Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature's orifice. The creature gets a Save to resist, and another Save at the end of each of its turns. 

**2. Knock**

**R**: 50' **T**: [dice] objects **D**: 0 

Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent open, belts come undone. Treat this as a Strength check made with Str 10 + [dice]x4. If target is an armoured creature, Save or armour falls off. If target is an unarmoured creature, Save or vomit for 1d4 rounds.

**3. Grease **

**R**: 50' **T**: object, surface **D**: [dice]x2 rounds 

Can be cast directly on a creature or [sum]10' x 10' surfaces. Creatures moving across the area must Save vs Dexterity or drop held objects, or, if moving, drop prone.

**4. Force Field**

**R**: 10' **T**: plane or sphere **D**: concentration

Creates a shimmering force field, 10‘x10’, centered up to 10' away. Alternatively, create a sphere centered on the caster 5' in diameter (large enough for the caster and +1 person.) The force field has [sum] HP. All attacks against it hit.

**5. Levitate **

**R**: 50' **T**: creature object **D**: concentration 

You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is [dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.

**6. Magic Missile**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0 Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As an Orthodox Wizard, your spell is unique to you, and can be any colour, shape, or pattern you describe. 

**7. Feather Fall **

**R**: 10’ **T**: [dice] creatures or objects **D**: 0 

If you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction to negate it. You float gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly late.) 

**8. Sleep**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: 10 min 

Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap (a standard action.) Non-alert, unaware targets are not allowed a Save. Can affect creatures up to [sum] HD. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

**9. Light**

**R**: touch **T**: object or creature **D**: [dice]x2 hours

Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous. 

**10. Wizard Vision**

**R**: touch **T**: sighted creature **D**: 10 min / permanent

If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see through illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated. 

If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above, except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects: (a) You can forever see invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else. (b) You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes. 

The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6 Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from your peers.) 

**Emblem Spells**

**11. Prismatic Ray **

**R**: 200' **T**: [dice] creatures or objects **D**: 0 

Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes the target. Roll a d10: 1. Red. Target takes [sum] fire damage, Save for half. 2. Orange. Target takes [sum] bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Save negates. 3. Yellow. Target takes [sum] lightning damage, save for half. 4. Green. Target takes [sum] acid damage, save for half. 5. Blue. Target takes [sum] ice damage, save for half. 6. Purple. Target takes [sum] necrotic damage and is blinded for [sum] rounds. Save negates. 7, 8, 9. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one save. 10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times. 

**12. Fireball **

**R**: 200' **T**: 20' diameter **D**: 0 

Does [sum] fire damage to all objects.

### Spell Descriptions

 

**1. Bartholomew's Pit**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target creature has the illusion of falling into bottomless pit filled with accusatory voices. Save negates. If they fail, the creature is stricken with a deep depression (if sentient) or lethargy (if mindless), and takes [sum] Charisma damage. If they are of [dice] HD or less, the effect lasts [sum] days, and if [sum] is greater than 12, the effect is permanent. If the target has more than [dice] HD, the effect lasts [sum] rounds.

**2. The Razor Spiral**

**R**: Self **T**: [dice]x10' radius **D**: concentration

Blades of invisible force fly around the caster. All creatures in area take 1d4 damage each round the spell is maintained. Roll damage for each creature individually, starting with those closest to the caster. The spell ends automatically when [sum]+3 damage has been dealt. The blades will also cut or damage fragile objects in the area.

**3. Oxhold's Lament**

**R**: 120' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target creature of [dice] HD or less must Save vs Fear or take a Morale check, or believe that someone close to them has suddenly and tragically died. They will not associate the caster with this death, but intelligent creatures may believe the caster is only informing them to cause them grief.

**4. Negasonic Ray**

**R**: [dice]x20‘ cone **T**: area **D**: concentration

Rippling rings of purple light pour from the caster's forehead. All sounds are cancelled within the area of this spell. Creatures are deafened until the spell ends or they leave the spell's area. 

**5. Summon Candles**

**R**: touch **T**: object **D**: 5 minutes / 3hrs

[sum] dribbly candles appear on objects you touch. You can walk around placing candles as required, for up to 5 minutes. The candles are lit and burn for 3 hours. They can be detached, but will fade from existence within 5 minutes. If any spells are cast within an area illuminated by a summoned candle, the candle's flame will turn blue and point to the caster.

**6. Perilous Bridge**

**R**: [dice]x100' **T**: object **D**: 1hr

A shimmering bridge of force appears from an object the caster touches, and extends, perfectly level, in a single direction. Both ends of the bridge must touch solid objects. The bridge is 1' wide and thin as a sheet of paper. Slowly walking across it does not require a Save vs Dexterity, but running or a slight breeze will require one. The bridge shatters if it is dealt any damage. 

**7. Wending Bolt**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target takes [sum] damage. You do not need to see the target, but you do need to know their approximate location (within 10'), and there must be a clear path a bolt could trace to reach them. The path can be as convoluted as required. The bolt can pass through gaps as small as a fist.

**8. Thunderclap**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target takes 1d6 damage. All creatures within [dice]x10' of the target are deafened for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the effect is permanent.

**9. Compartmentalize Mixture**

**R**: touch **T**: object **D**: 1hr

Command a mixture of items (a soup, a pile of coins) that weigh no more than [dice]x100lbs to separate into [sum]+1 categories. The separation is slow, and hindered by even the slightest effort. The categories must be clearly defined and identifiable by inspection. For example, you could split a soup into "vegetables" "broth" and "poison", or a pile of coins into "minted during the last century" and "older". You could not, however, split a pile of coins into "handled by Xerphion the Tyrant" and "not handled by Xerphion the Tyrant", as there's no way to tell just by inspecting them. You could not separate "a locked chest" and "its contents", because the items could not flow freely into separate piles.

**10. Master Ludwig's Guiding Lights**

**R**: [dice]x1 miles **T**: self **D**: [sum] hours

Small glowing lights flow from your fingertips. They are as bright as a match, but you can always see them, even in bright sunlight or pitch darkness, at any distance up to 1 mile. The lights guide the caster to an object, person, or location that they believe will result in the emotional state named when the spell is cast. If the caster names "love", they will lead to the nearest sexually compatible person of similar age. If the caster names "joy" they might lead to a well of nitrous oxide, or to a pile of treasure, or to a crude goblin joke scrawled on a wall. The lights are not malicious, but they are not very clever. 

**11. Roaring Flames**

**R**: 30' cone **T**: area **D**: 0

A wide cone of crackling fire races across the ground. Creatures in the area take [sum] damage, Save vs Dex for half. The flames are particularly damaging to inanimate objects, which take [sum]x2 damage. Creatures and objects are not set on fire by this spell.

**12. The Astrologer's Helper**

**R**: 10' **T**: self **D**: [sum] minutes

Outlines of the planets, major stars, sun, and moon appear around you. You can use them to determine the time of day, true north, and your approximate position on the globe. You can also spend 5 minutes to read the horoscope of [dice] sentient creatures per casting. Roll 1d10. 1-8. No effect aside from the usual platitudes. 9. Doom. Creature must reroll their next Save and take the worse result. 10. Triumph. Creature automatically passes their next Save.

**13. Heroic Leap**

**R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: [dice] minutes

Target can leap up to [sum]x5' high and/or [sum]x5' forward in a straight line. They take no damage on landing, provided they land on or above the level they started from. For example, you could leap from the ground to top of a steeple, or you could leap over the steeple to land on the ground, but you couldn't leap from the top of a steeple to the ground. On landing, the target may Save vs Dex with a +[dice] bonus to change direction and repeat the leap. You cannot cast spells or attack while leaping.

**14. The Magnificent Sponge**

**R**: touch **T**: point **D**: [dice] hours

You summon a yellow sponge the size of your head. The sponge can instantly absorb up to [sum]x100L of liquid without growing heavier. You can squeeze the liquid free, but only at the rate of a normal sponge (10L/minute.) The sponge can be reused if it is wrung out completely. If you cast this spell with 4 [dice], the sponge lasts for a year and a day, but the spell does not return to your spellbook until the sponge duration expires or the sponge is dispelled. The sponge is impervious to harm caused by the liquids it absorbs.

**15. Ice-Bridge Step**

**R**: touch **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: [sum] minutes

You can run over water as if it were land. Ice forms beneath your feet with each step. If you slow down, you'll sink. Very wavy seas may require you to Save vs Dex.

**16. Embroider Deed**

R. Touch **T**: object (cloth) **D**: permanent

By dictating descriptions of your heroic deeds, you can cause a tapestry to sew itself into cloth you provide. The cloth can be as small as a handkerchief or as large as a house's wall. The deeds must focus on you and your actions, but other characters can be added in, as required by the story. The tapestry is worth [sum]x10gp. It takes [dice] hours of work to dictate the tale, and if you are interrupted, you must Save or the spell fails.

**17. Multielemental Spray**

R. 15' cone **T**: area **D**: varies

If [sum] is equal to or greater a creature in the area's HD, they take 1d4 fire damage. If [sum] is twice the creature's HD or more, they also take 1d4 cold damage. If [sum] is three times the creature's HD or more, they take 1d4 lightning damage. If [sum] is four times the creature's HD or more, they also take 1d4 acid damage and are knocked prone. 

**18. Miniature Sandstorm**

**R**: 30’ radius **T**: self **D**: [dice] hours

You cough up a swirling spiral of sand. Everything up to 30' away from you is obscured. The sand deals no damage, but creatures move at half speed within the sandstorm's effect. 

**19. Embed Memory**

R. touch **T**: creature **D**: varies

You pull a single memory out of your head and transfer it to another creature. Unwilling creatures may Save to negate. The memory must be short, and it must be distinct. The memory is perfectly vivid for [sum] days but begins to fade after that. If [sum] is greater than 12, the memory will never fade, even if the target loses all other memories.

**20. Moon Lust**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: varies

Target creature loves the moon. They want to stare at it, jump up and hold it, or write poems about it. If [sum] is equal to or greater than the target's HD, they are stunned for 1d6 rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the target is stunned for 2d6 rounds and becomes permanently obsessed with the moon.

**21. Orbiting Spikes**

**R**: 30' **T**: self **D**: [sum] rounds

You summon [dice] daggers of force that orbit your head like a very angry halo. With a thought, even if you are doing something else, you can throw a spike at a target. Treat this as a thrown dagger, but with a maximum range of 30'. You can throw one spike per round.

**22. Resonating Command**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature that can hear and understand you **D**: 3 rounds

You shout a single-word command to your target, who must Save or obey. For two rounds after you cast this spell, it resonates. Targets who previously passed their Save must Save again at the beginning of the next 2 rounds, with a +4 bonus the first round and a +8 bonus the second. The command cannot directly cause the target harm, or force them to commit a directly harmful action. You could cause them to run into a trap they didn't know was there, or into a tactically disadvantageous position, but not off a cliff. For each [dice] you add past the first, you can affect 2 additional creatures, or add an additional word to your command. 

**23. Flip Person**

**R**: 50' **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: 0

Target creatures with total HD of [sum] or less are flipped head-over-heels, to land on their feet unharmed and in the same position. Loose items, coins, etc. may be shaken free. Targets must Save or be stunned for 1 round.

**24. Sword of Infamy**

**R**: touch **T**: sword **D**: [sum] rounds

Creatures killed by a sword you target reveal their souls briefly before death. For most creatures, the soul appears as a small, vaporous homunculus which vanishes after a few moments. This effect may cause a Save vs Fear or a Morale check.

**25. Hammon's Arrow-Directing Lens**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: [sum] rounds

A lens of force appears 5' over the target. Any arrows that pass within [dice]x10' of the lens are directed to the target. Make a new attack roll if the arrows would have ordinarily missed the target. This only affects arrows, not stones, spears, or crossbow bolts.

**26. Pergaman's Synesthesia**

**R**: touch **T**: creature of [dice]x2 HD or less **D**: [sum] rounds

The target's senses are confused and mixed. Colours also evoke sounds. Tastes evoke flashes of light. Different textures cause different flavours. The target is befuddled for the spell's duration. If [sum] is greater than 12 the effect is permanent, but the target will become used to their new senses and no longer befuddled in 20-Int days.

**27. Lengthen Limbs**

**R**: touch **T**: willing creature **D**: [sum] minutes

Up to [dice]x2 of the target's limbs double in length. If all a creature's walking limbs are affected, the creature's move speed is also doubled for the duration of the spell. Weapons wielded in a lengthened limb can reach farther than normal. This effect does not change the structure or form of the limbs. It merely affects one of the many dimensions surrounding them, which also causes the limbs to appear farther away than usual. If you invest 3 or more [dice] the spell's duration becomes [sum] hours.

**28. Alter Local Gravity**

**R**: 50' **T**: [sum]x5' squares **D**: [sum] rounds

You must cast this spell indoors, in an area with a solid roof no more than 50' high. An areas that you specify has its gravity altered a) an angle that you specify (90 degrees left, 180 degrees up), or b) to a lower strength that you specify (50%, 0%) for the duration of the spell. The spell's effect takes place gradually, giving creatures a chance to Save vs Dex to hang on to something. Creatures take fall damage as normal. In lower gravity, you can jump proportionately higher and farther, but virtually any action requires a Save vs Dex. If you invest 3 or more [dice] the spell's duration becomes a year and a day.

**29. Thicken Air**

**R**: 50' **T**: [sum]x5' squares, 50' high **D**: [sum] rounds

Air in an area you select becomes as dense as water. You can still breathe it, but you can also swim in it. Projectiles passing through the area count as moving twice as far for range penalties. Flying creatures entering the area must Save or be stunned for one round. If you invest 3 or more [dice] the spell's duration becomes a year and a day.

**30. Scything Disc of Nog**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0

You fire a whirling disc of force and light from your fingertip. The disc screeches like a sawblade. It deals [sum] damage to its target. If it deals more than 6 damage, it bounces towards a random creature within 20', dealing [sum]-2 damage. If it deals more than 6 damage, it bounces towards another random creature within 20', dealing [sum]-4 damage. This continues, losing 2 damage with each bounce, until there are no valid targets or the spell deals 6 or less damage to a creature. 

**31. Delayed Noxious Odour Sphere**

**R**: 50' **T**: point **D**: [sum] rounds/0

A marble-sized bead of grey-green ooze lands at a point you select. At any time within [sum] rounds, you can cause the sphere to detonate. Any creatures within a 20' of the sphere's detonation must Save vs Constitution or flee the area, as a failed Morale check, to wash. The area is filled with a thick green mist that lasts for [dice] hours. The spell does not affect creatures with no sense of smell, mindless creatures, or creatures who habitually live in filth (goblins, shambling mounds, etc.)

**32. Scuttle**

**R**: touch **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: [sum] minutes

Your clothes and hair animate to carry you. You can move at full speed in any orientation, and you can freely rotate as you move. For instance, you could run while standing on your head, holding a torch, and turning counterclockwise. You can lie on your side and, while flipping end over end, move backwards. This effect does not allow you to climb up walls, but you can climb ladders or rope at twice your usual speed. 

**33. Gelatinous Form**

**R**: touch **T**: self **D**: [sum] minutes

Your flesh becomes gelatinous. You can squeeze through gaps as small as keyhole with a great deal of effort. You take no damage from bludgeoning weapons for the duration of the spell. Any acid damage you take heals HP instead. Your clothes and items are not affected by this spell.

**34. Transfer Exhaustion**

**R**: 20' **T**: self, creature **D**: 0

This spell can only be cast if you are exhausted. At a bare minimum, you need one sleepless or restless night. You bundle your exhaustion into a ball and toss it at a creature. The creature must Save or be stunned for [dice] rounds. You immediately heal [dice]x2 HP. The creature may take on some aspects of your personality. This spell has no effect if you have less than 0 HP.

**35. William's Fingerbreaker**

**R**: 100' **T**: creature of [dice]x2 HD or less **D**: 0

The target of this spell must have fingers. You snap your fingers and your target's fingers crack, break, and bend. They take [sum] damage and must immediately Save or drop whatever they are holding. You can choose to have the target take no damage, but they get +2 to their Save. 

**36. Geld Animal**

The target must Save or take 1 damage, and lose [dice]+1d4 Strength, to a minimum of 1, for the duration of this spell. The target is also rendered sterile for the duration.

This spell only works on living creatures capable of reproducing.

**37. Draw Heat**

**R**: [dice]x100' **T**: 2 objects or creatures **D**: concentration

You must have at least two working eyes to cast this spell. You stare at one target with one eye, and another target with another. You can transfer heat between them. For example, if you stared at a torch, you could transfer the fire's heat (1d6 damage)/round) to a creature. You can do nothing else while casting this spell. You cannot amplify the heat, so a candle's flame cannot melt an iron bar, but you could transfer the icy cold of a glacier to a campfire and extinguish it.

**38. Thurmond's Prolonged Bombardment**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature or object **D**: [sum] rounds

Each round, a fist-size sphere of force appears and slams into the target, dealing 1d6+[dice] damage. Save each round to negate. If the target is human-sized or smaller and takes 7 damage, it is also knocked prone. 

**39. Visualize Madness**

**R**: 20' **T**: creature **D**: [sum] minutes

Target must be insane. The spell create an illusory scene above the target's head that conveys their insanity. If a king believes himself to be an owl, the illusion might show a forest of trees and a grey owl crowned with gold flitting among them. If the target is paranoid, shadowy figures with long knives might surround their head, plotting and muttering. The target cannot see the illusion.

**40. Cuspit's Swarm of Irritating Vermin**

**R**: 50' **T**: [dice] creatures or objects **D**: [sum] rounds

A cloud of tiny magical insects attack your target. They do 1 damage per round to living creatures and no damage to nonliving creatures or objects. Each round, a non-mindless creature must Save or take a -2 penalty to their next Attack. If the target is an object, the vermin will do minor cosmetic damage, such as chewing holes in paper, gnawing wood, chipping paint, and scratching glass. 

**41. Cone of Dense Foam**

**R**: [dice]x10' cone **T**: area **D**: 0

A huge cone of white foam sprays from your hand. It's as dense as porridge, but tastes like seawater. Creatures inside must Save vs Con or begin to drown unless they struggle free. Any creatures covered in foam have -2 to Attack until they can wash. 

**42. Weighty Sphere**

**R**: touch **T**: point **D**: [sum] hours

You summon a stone sphere with a radius up to [dice]x2'. The sphere is immensely heavy. 2' radius: 2.5 tons. 4' radius: 22.5 tons. 6' radius: 78 tons. 8' radius: 182 tons. It is perfectly smooth and very difficult to lift. You must summon the stone onto a stable surface. For example, you can't summon it by touching water or sand, but you could summon it on top of a flimsy wooden railing. If you invest 3 or more [dice], you can make the spell's duration permanent.

**43. Duelist's Wings**

**R**: touch **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: [sum] rounds

Tiny white wings sprout from your ankles and wrists. In combat, you may make a free Combat Maneuver to reposition yourself each turn. Your move speed increases by 5' and you reduce all fall damage by 2. 

**44. Screaming Teeth**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: [sum] varies

Target's teeth scream whenever the target opens its mouth. The screaming is very unpleasant, and causes them to lose [dice]+1d4 Charisma, to a minimum of 1, for the duration of the spell.

**R**: touch **T**: sentient humanoid creature **D**: [sum] varies, see below

Target's clothes transform into livery. Other minor cosmetic effects, such as a change in hair colour, may also occur. The target appears to be a minor servant or hireling. This effect is so convincing that even people close to the target will believe the target has been demoted or promoted, and must Save to believe otherwise. The target may Save at the end of each duration interval to negate the effects. 1 [dice]: minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: months, 4 [dice] years

**47. Ulric's Beam of Blindness**

If it strikes a creature or object, it deals 1d6 fire damage and then explodes into sparkles. 

**50. Identify Owner**

**R**: touch **T**: object **D**: 1 minute

Letters appear over the object you touch, spelling out the name of the object's owner or owners. If the object has no owners, the spell fails. If you invest 2 [dice] the spell will also show if the ownership is disputed. Dead people cannot dispute ownership. If you invest 3 [dice], arrows will appear pointing in the approximate direction of the owner (or a skull will appear if they are deceased.) The name revealed will be name the owner used when they purchased or acquired the object. For example, if Tabitha Winklewort was using her alias "Jane Crow" when she bought her boots, the name listed would be Jane Crow. If you targeted a ring she stole and invested 2 [dice] or more, the names listed would be Jane Crow and Baron Summerland. If you invest 4 [dice], true names will be listed alongside aliases, provided the owners are mortal. This spell also works on slaves and domesticated animals. 

**51. Become Delicious**

**R**: touch **T**: creature of [dice]x2 HD or less **D**: [sum] varies

Insects will be attracted to the target for the spell's duration. The target may Save at the end of each duration interval to negate the effects. 1 [dice]: minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: months, 4 [dice] years. This spell can also affect dead creatures.

**R**: 50' **T**: point **D**: [dice]+1 rounds

A 5' cube of grey light appears in the air at a point you specify. It can be targeted by non-magical attacks (Defense 10, 5 HP) and disappears if it takes more than 5 damage. At any point during the spell's duration, spells that enter the cube through one of it's faces will be split, and identical copies will fire out of the spell's 5 other faces. The copies are not specifically targeted, but will hit any valid targets in their path, and within the original spell's range. For example, you could fire a magic missile straight through the cube at a target 30' away from the cube. Four other magic missiles would fire from the other four sides of the cube and disappear after 30' unless they hit a target or obstacle within 30'. Touch spells and spells with a range of "self" are not affected. Other spellcasters can use your cube.

**53. Entangling Smoke**

**R**: 50' **T**: [dice]x2 objects or creatures **D**: varies

**54. Capture Wind**

**R**: touch **T**: point **D**: concentration

A magical circle [dice]x2' in radius extends from your fingertip. As long as you maintain concentration, you can absorb any wind passing through the circle. You can then collapse the spell. At any point, as long as you devote a spell slot to maintaining the spell, you can reactivate it with the same radius (no [dice] are needed) to release the wind you absorbed. The wind flows out at the same rate it entered. If you activate this spell in a light breeze for 5 minutes, the spell will release a light breeze over 5 minutes. The wind only flows from the circle, so anyone standing behind it is not affected (unless you release hurricane-force winds indoors.) You can cancel the release at any time, which expends the spell as usual. If you die while this spell is "loaded" and in your brain, it activates facing a random direction.

**55. Enfeebling Sigil**

**R**: touch, 50' **T**: object **D**: [sum] rounds

A writhing arcane symbol appears on an object you touch. Any creature within 100' of the sigil who looks at it must Save or be reduced to Strength 1 for [dice] rounds. Nothing can cause their Strength to drop lower than 1 while they are under the effects of this spell. The symbol vanishes after [sum] rounds.

**56. Redwyn's Excellent Clamp **

**R**: 30' **T**: object **D**: [sum] varies

A clamp of red light appears over one or two objects you designate. The maximum width of the clamp is [dice]x10'.

If you designated an orc's shirt and the back of a chair as targets, the clamp would firmly secure the orc to the chair. The clamp must be able to fit around the objects. You could not secure a chair to the floor or walls. Creatures can break free with an opposed Strength check, and, most of the time, can wriggle free in a few hours. The spell lasts for 1 [dice]: minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: days, 4 [dice] months, or permanent. 

**57. Light's Own Scourge**

**R**: [dice]x20' radius **T**: light sources in area **D**: 0

All light sources in the radius of this spell deal damage to the creature nearest to them. Candles and matches deal no damage. Torches and lanterns deal 1d6 damage. Bonfires deal 2d6 damage.

**58. Scamper's Bouncing Sphere of Destruction**

**R**: touch **T**: point **D**: [sum] rounds

A small yellow sphere appears on your fingertip and fires off at enormous speed. Any creatures struck must Save or be stunned for 1 round. If you cast this spell outside, or in a very large room with multiple exits, you strike 1 target before the spell vanishes into the distance. If you cast this spell indoors, in a room with a limited number of exits, the sphere is trapped and begins to bounce around at high speed. The effects depend on the room size. 400 square feet or less (20'x20'): all creatures must Save or be stunned each round for the spell's duration.

**R**: 20' **T**: objects **D**: concentration / permanent

Up to [dice]x500lbs of nonliving objects, as you designate, are packed neatly. You must name the objects or their general category when you cast the spell ("those coins", "the contents of that room") If no packing materials are provided, the objects will be stacked into compact cubes, with the largest and most stable objects at the bottom. If chests, paper and twine, sacks, carts, etc. are provided, the spell will use them as you direct. The packages created will take up the minimum space possible, and will be remarkably sturdy. The spell will continue to pack objects for as long as you maintain concentration. The objects must be able to move freely. You could not use this spells to pack clothes someone was wearing.

The water sprayed by the stone does not deal damage, but it has a 50% chance to extinguish torches. The water disappears once it passes more than 100' from the stone.

You can cast this spell as a reaction. You halve the duration, effects, and/or damage of a spell that would affect you or anything within [dice]x10' of you.

You could not compare a stone to a mouse, but you could compare a mouse to a man. If you invest 2 [dice], the effect lasts for [sum] days. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, the effect is permanent.

Buried or covered objects rise to the surface in area you designate, [dice]x10' in radius. If you cast this spell on the ground, coins, stones, and root will be pulled to the surface. If you cast it on water, sunken objects will rise to the surface and remain there as long as you maintain concentration. The total weight of dredged objects cannot exceed [dice]x100lbs. If you cast this spell targeting creatures in the area instead, the creatures must Save or be stunned for 1 round. If [sum] is greater than 12, they also take 1d6 damage and are knocked prone. Instead of targeting area, you can instead target a single sentient creature. The creature must Save (if unwilling) or recall a memory in perfect detail.

Targets that are very flammable (soaked in oil, dry wood) may not get a Save. You can target this spell precisely enough to light the wick of a single candle in a bundle, provided you can see the wick.
