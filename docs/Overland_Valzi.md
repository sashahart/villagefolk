# Overland Travel

## Overland Travel Chart

When traveling across plains a character may travel as many miles as their movement score in a day, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 6, without gaining FATIGUE. (This is because a hex is typically 6 miles wide. A party cannot partially enter a hex.)

| Party MOVEMENT | Miles per day without FATIGUE | Hexes per day without FATIGUE | Hours per hex |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1-5            | 0                             | 0                             | Cannot travel |
| 6-11           | 6                             | 1                             | 12            |
| 12-17          | 12                            | 2                             | 6             |
| 18-23          | 18                            | 3                             | 4             |
| 24-35          | 24                            | 4                             | 3             |
| 36-71          | 36                            | 6                             | 2             |
| 72             | 72                            | 12                            | 1             |

------

The average party member has a movement of 12. If the slowest party member has a movement of 12, the party may explore 6 miles in 6 hours.

## Terrain

> **Plains = no change**
> **Road** = -2 hours (min of 1 hour.)
> **Hills** = +1 hour.
> **Forest and Desert** = +2 hours.
> **Jungle and Swamp**  = +3 hours.
> **Mountain**  = +4 hours.

| **Terrain** | **Hours**              |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Plains      | No change              |
| Road        | -2 (minimum of 1 hour) |
| Hills       | +1                     |
| Forest      | +2                     |
| Desert      | +2                     |
| Jungle      | +3                     |
| Swamp       | +3                     |
| Mountain    | +4                     |

## Overland Sight

Characters can usually see for three miles around them, in open terrain. 

This range may sometimes be reduced (e.g. in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or increased (e.g. looking out from the top of a mountain.)

## Other actions

1d4 exploding turns to find the source of tracks.
Roll under half Wisdom in order to Hunt, Forage, or gather Herbs. 

Hunting requires to rolls of an arrow usage die and results in 1d4 rations.
**Foraging**
Gathering herbs finds a single herb.

### Foraging

A party may forage when in a wilderness environment. (Doing this requires every party member's turn.) It does not take extra time or slow travel, but it may only be done once per 6 miles per day. Roll under half the Wisdom of one party member to  gain the party enough food for d6 meals (a meal is only half of a ration.)

### Hunting

A party may hunt when in a wilderness environment. It requires one hour and causes two encounter checks. Roll under half of a party member's Wisdom and spend 2 arrows.

A character may attempt to roll under half of their wisdom in order to Hunt, Forage, or find Herbs. Hunting costs 1d4 arrows and gives 1d4 rations. Foraging gives 1d3 rations. Herbalism gives a single beneficial herb which can act as medicine.

## Daylight

Traveling at night is nearly impossible without a road. (You might choose to make an exception for a full moon.) 

When night travel occurs, increase the probability of a random encounter by one die face at night. (This usually means a 2 in 6 chance of an encounter.)

Winter - 8 hours of light
Spring/Fall - 11 hours of light
Summer - 14 hours of light

## Navigating Accurately

To navigate accurately (without getting lost,) check MOVE with the following changes:

Plain = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]+7 
Mountain, Hill, Forest = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]-5
Desert, Jungle, Swamp = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]-2

Keeping a large landmark in sight can improve or ensure the chances of accurate navigation, according to the referee's decision.

When lost, the party randomly moves to a different hex adjacent to the one intended.

------

> Alternately, the GM can roll 1d6 and consult the Overland Travel Chart to determine whether the party becomes lost. This allows the referee to avoid telling the players that they went the wrong way allowing nothing more than a description the environment they find themselves moving through.

## Hex Travel

The standard hex size is 6x6 miles wide.

For the sake of simplicity, assume the party is at the center of the hex they begin in and that their destination is at the center of the hex they stop traveling in.

However, the referee (or a published adventure) may choose other measurements.

------

When moving from one 6-mile hex into another one, the total distance travelled is 6 miles. 

When moving all the way across one hex and ending in a new hex adjacent to it, the distance travelled is 9 miles.

## Exploring a hex

| **Choose one of the below:** | Obvious   | Not Obvious | Hidden           | Well-hidden |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **D6 result**                | [No Roll] | 1-3         | 1-2              | 1           |
| **MOVE Check**               | [No Roll] | MOVE+WIS-2  | Check MOVE+WIS-5 | MOVE+WiS-9  |

Obvious features are discovered upon moving into a hex.

To explore the hex the characters are in, spend the same number of hours it would cost to move into the current hex (consult the Overland Travel Chart.) Then roll 1d6 to determine if unnoticed features of interest are discovered. (Give a bonus to this roll equal to the Wisdom modifier of a party member who has knowledge of this kind of terrain.)

> Alternate system to allow players to roll and to allow player wisdom to alter the outcome
> To navigate without getting lost:
> Plain = Check MOVE + [WIS+7] 
> Mountain, Hill, Forest = Check MOVE + [WIS-5]
> Desert, Jungle, Swamp = Check MOVE + [WIS-2]
