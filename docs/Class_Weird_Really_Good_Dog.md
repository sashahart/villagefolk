**Dog**
Your Movement is 15, but you lack hands and cannot climb ropes. Your fur coat gives you Defense +3 as if it were armor, but takes up no Inventory Slots. You have half as many Inventory Slots as usual. Your bite deals 1d6+Str damage and is a Light Weapon. You can recognize scents. You can “talk” freely with people who have known you a long time (other PCs), but are otherwise limited to doggy communication. You are fluent in Canine.

You roll you Intelligence score normally, but be aware that this is doggy intelligence. You'll never be able to do calculus, but you can notice the seams of a trap or spot a counterfeit coin.

**Best Friends**
Pick another PC to be your best friend. Whenever you are both adjacent to each other, you both get +2 on all d20 rolls that you make at the same time, against the same thing.

**Lick**
If your best friend is Dying, you can lick their face to restore 1 HP. If your best friend is ever out of control (paralyzed, mind-controlled, raging, etc) you can nip them to give them a new save against the effect.

**Wag**
When you wag your tail, humanoid children of all species must save as if vs charm person.

**Sniff**
As detect evil and detect magic except range is 3”.

**Growl**
A single enemy must Save vs Fear or be unable to attack or approach you for one turn. Doesn't work ifyou are non-threatening. Growling is a standard
action.

**Takedown**
Whenever you bite an opponent and get a 2 or a 3 on the Attack Roll, you may make a Str check opposed by your targets Str or Dex (whichever is higher). If you succeed, you trip your target.

**Epic Nose**
If you spend a minute sniffing a creature, you can learn a terrific amount of things about it. You learn the answers to 1 question about the creature's habits (e.g. “Does it work for the druid?”, “What dungeon level is it from?”). If it is possible to follow a trail by scent, you can follow that trail by scent.

**Dog Quest**
At some point in your career, you will attract the attention of the Dog Barons, who will give you a quest to prove your doggishness. Example quests include killing a Cat Prince (rakshasa) who is hiding in town somewhere, digging into a forgotten barrow and returning with the femur from the wight king who was buried there, or rescuing some asshole prince who fell down a well in orcish territory. (This will
probably involve the other PCs chasing after you shouting "Where are you going, boy? Come back!") If you refuse or fail this quest, you will be shunned by the Dog Clans of the cities. If you succeed, you will win allies among the Dog Clans, and can call on their help in the cities. 

Examples of help: gossip, relaying messages, safe houses, and/or the assistance of a pack of mangy street dogs.
