# Starting items

A party always starts with the basics: a lantern, 3 flasks of oil (which fill one slot.)

Each player character also starts with a backpack (which does not use a slot and grants two extra slots) a blanket (1 slot) a waterskin (1 slot)  1 meal, 2 rations (2 slots) and flint and tinder (0 slots.)

Some classes or professions might also include items.

Match your highest attribute score (the column on the left) with your starting HP to determine what other starting items you have.
