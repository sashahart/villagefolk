## Exorcist

### The Body and the Soul

In my setting, spells and souls belong in the same category. If someone curses you, they stick a parasite-thing on your soul. If you are enchanted, your soul might be altered or edited. The soul drives the body and not the other way around. Very powerful and willful creatures like dragons don't[*need* ](http://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-unique-death-conditions.html)a body the same way more fragile creatures do. 

Angels, demons, [summoned entities](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/04/osr-100-entities-you-can-summon.html), creatures created by spells, and some other spirits are pure spell-stuff. Their bodies are just an extension or aspect of their souls.

[Elementals ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/03/osr-what-does-elemental-want.html)are slightly different. As far as anyone can tell, their matter *is* their soul.

### Abominations

An abomination is defined as "that which offends the Authority". The Church recognizes three major categories Abomination as particularly dangerous and, over the centuries, has created special orders and rites to combat them. Not all the examples listed below are abominated by the Church; anything listed as "Also Affects" is just incidental stuff that behaves in the same way, effectively, but which the Church has not specifically abominated. These edge cases might lead to some very weird interactions between Exorcist abilities and the things they encounter. This is intentional.

**Embodied Undead: **Skeletons, zombies, wights, liches, and vampires. Creatures whose bodies died, but whose souls lived on, driving the body. Corpses possessed by a spell or spirit. Also Affects: enchanted weapons, wands, armour, spellbooks, golems and constructs. 

**Incorporeal Undead: **Ghosts, banshees, spectres, and shadows. Creatures whose bodies died, but whose souls lived on and roam freely. Also Affects: spells, angels, summoned demons, summoned entities.

**Possessive Undead: **Demons, powerful ghosts, and some diseases. Creatures whose  original bodies died but whose souls live on in the body of other living creatures. Two souls in the same flesh. Also Affects: persistent spells that affect a living target, curses.

### Class: Exorcist

Starting Equipment: traveling robes, ceremonial robes. Other equipment varies by Role.

Starting Skill: Religion.

You gain +1 Save vs Fear for each Exorcist template you possess.

### Role

1. [Bell](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/09/osr-class-bell-exorcists.html)
2. [Book](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/09/osr-class-book-exorcist.html)
3. [Sword](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/10/osr-class-sword-exorcist.html)

## [OSR: Class: Book Exorcist](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/09/osr-class-book-exorcist.html)

Starting Equipment: holy symbol

Starting Skill: [Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rjGTOA2NA&feature=youtu.be&t=24s)

The Church has chosen you to fight Possessive Undead. You are most effective against spirits that inhabit the bodies of the living. You might be a priest who stumbled into the practice of exorcism by necessity or fate. You might be a holy healer, outside the normal doctrines of the Church. You might be a monk exiled for some grievous sin, seeking redemption, or a callous and grizzled combatant in a hidden spiritual war. 

To most people, demons and evil spirits are the same - *everyone *knows that demons sent by the Adversary plague the living. The truth is more complicated. Demons were created by the Authority to tempt the living from the path of righteousness. They have no power over the devout and cannot harm the innocent. Demons aren't even malicious. They are probably more religious and open-minded than most people, even if their profession makes them deeply cynical. However, as natural rule-breakers and order-corrupters, some demons seek to escape their role and live a different life. These rogue demons are the ones the Church hunts. Proper orthodox demons who do their task are left alone, but they aren't the ones possessing the faithful.

Similarly, the souls of wicked men and women seek to avoid judgement and hide inside the bodies of the living. An excommunicated soul knows there is only one fate waiting for it. If it can sneak into the body of a living person and either meld or overpower their soul, it can live again, free of consequence and worry. Most cases of possession are not demons at all, but corrupt ancestors and old ghosts.
Finally, some diseases are caused by evil spirits of one form or another, and can be exorcised. Diseases caused by living creatures, poison, foul air, inheritance, or self-inflicted spiritual harm cannot be cured by an exorcist. 

### Templates

A: Rite of Exorcism, Literacy, Keen Eye

B: Doctrinal Skill, Soul of Iron

C: Brandish

D: Doctrinal Mastery

**Rite of Exorcism**

Through ritual and prayer, you invoke the Authority's power and restore the natural order of Creation. Make an opposed Charisma check against a spirit, demon, or disease inside a living creature. You must be within 10' of the creature to make this check, and the creature must be able to see and hear you. If you pass, the spirit is banished. If you fail, you take the creature's [HD] in damage. You can attempt this test once per hour. Multiple failed attempts may lead you to doubt your own faith or abilities (see below.)

> **Bonuses**
> +1 per Book Exorcist template. Up to two Book Exorcists can work on the same exorcism, adding their templates together. If a regular priest of the Authority or a very devout lay person assists instead, they add +1.
> +1 per hour spent in uninterrupted ritual before attempting the test.  

> **Penalties**
> -1 per HD of the spirit
> -2 if the spirit has possessed the target for more than a day, a week, a month, or a year (so a year = -8)
> -some number, determined by the GM, if you doubt your own faith, abilities, or cause, or if you are in poor standing with the Church.

The minimum requirements to begin an exorcism are a holy book and a holy symbol. The spirit may attempt to interrupt the ritual several times, requiring Saves vs Fear, Saves to Dodge, etc. Restraints may be required.

**Literacy**

You can read and write. [A surprising number of people](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-medieval-correspondence-part-1-now.html?showComment=1500755925988#c3132873264689852595) could do both in the middle ages, but you can *really *write. Your letters can allow for Charisma tests at a distance. You can roll to see the intentions of an author, the delicate themes of a poem, and the inconsistencies in a complex text. To most people this is a kind of sorcery.

**Keen Eye**

You know the signs of possession well, and can determine if a creature is afflicted [or not ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGb8pMIeY6w)by a few simple tests. You can also diagnose diseases (as the Medicine skill) but not assign treatments or offer advice. You can separate the mad, the attention-seeking, and the injured from the truly possessed. 

**Doctrinal Skill**

You are an unparalleled expert on the holy books. You can find a passage or an appropriate phrase instantly. If you choose to challenge a point of canon law, you can *always *find relevant precedents, counterexamples, and devastating flaws. For example, you could challenge the appointment of a bishop, the fitness of a village priest, the [validity of a marriage](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/08/osr-annulments-divorces-and-secrets.html), or the interpretation of a command from the Archpriest. Listeners do not have to believe you, but they will admit there is a possibility you are correct, and either allow a court case or have you silenced by force.

**Soul of Iron**

You can spend 1 HP to gain a +2 bonus to any Save against Fear, a direct demonic attack (such as hellfire or soul drain),  or any soul-altering effect (such as a curse, a compulsion, or any other personal enchantment.) You can spend as many HP as you would like, including inflicting [Lethal Damage](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-death-and-dismemberment-table-early.html) on yourself. Wounds you take appear as stigmata or premature aging. You only gain this ability after performing a successful exorcism. Additionally, if you ever roll a natural 1 (critical success) on a Save vs Fear, all allies who can see you automatically pass their Saves vs Fear (or rally if already fleeing.)

**Brandish**

If you suddenly raise your holy symbol, you can cause any undead (not just possessive undead), spirit, or spell to turn aside. They must Save to approach within 10' of you. Creatures get a bonus to Save equal to their HD. Spells get a bonus equal to the number of magic dice used to cast them. Some spells might be deflected and seek a new target. Very minor undead creatures or spirits (1 HD or less) must Save or be banished.

As long as you keep the symbol raised (Save vs. Constitution every hour as your arm gets tired), the creatures or spells first affected by this spell cannot approach you. If you attempt to use this ability while in doubt over your own faith or abilities, nothing happens.

**Doctri****nal Mastery**

Your expertise has reached nearly supernatural levels. Any issue of canon, *secular, or natural *law you challenge is likely to be decided in your favour, no matter what the case is, although there may still be arguments (or attempts on your life.) You can also argue directly against [ancient courts](http://falsemachine.blogspot.ca/2017/05/encountering-wapentake.html), Angels, Demons, the [Adversary](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0602901h.html), or the [Authority ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oven_of_Akhnai#The_Story)and, often, win. If [an angel turns up to kill your friends](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-creature-paradox-angels.html), you can probably convince it to go away.

### Mechanical Notes on the Book Exorcist

Again, this is a highly specialized class. You're more likely to encounter embodied undead than possessive undead in any given game, so without the GM customizing certain portions of a pre-existing module, this class may not seem that useful at first. However, the Exorcism ability also works on curses and some diseases. Both turn up on a regular basis. The Brandish ability works on a wide variety of targets. Deflecting spells is not to be underestimated.

But the major secondary feature of this class comes from the Law skill, the Religion skill, and the Doctrinal and Literacy abilities. This class is effectively a ghost-fighting lawyer. The descriptions of just what a PC can do to dispute "canon, secular, or natural law" are left vague. I want to see what kind of nonsense people get up to with this ability. Paladins might be able to command the sea to part, but a Book Exorcist could convince it to divide as a point of order.

Also, if you choose to be an ordained member of the First Estate, you can hear confessions, officiate at weddings, sell [indulgences](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-indulgences-and-clerical-services.html), and generally interfere with the workings of all three Estates.

## [OSR: Class: Bell Exorcists](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/09/osr-class-bell-exorcists.html)

**Starting Equipment: **The Seven Bells.

The Church has chosen you to fight the Embodied Undead. You are most effective against spirits that inhabit dead bodies. Graveyards and catacombs are your battleground; gravedust is your incense and your mark. You carry the most powerful tools the Church can forge against such enemies, but every necromancer in Creation also desires your weapons. 
You may belong to a small [monastic order](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/09/osr-dear-abbey-my-sister-has-this-habit.html?showComment=1506053348244#c4233023159334188004), or you may be a specially trained priest, or you may be something else entirely. Exorcists are both rare and mysterious. Some people will mistake you for a heretic, a charlatan, or a necromancer. Speak little of your past and conceal your intentions and abilities.

------

**Templates**

A: Bell Casting, 4 Bell Dice

B: Undead Sense, 4 Bell Dice

C: Name Them, 3 Bell Dice

D: Dual Bells, 2 Bell Dice

### Bell Casting

You start with 4 Bell Dice (BD), but *lose *them as you gain templates in this Role. Bell Dice are d6s.  Whenever you start using a Bell, or change a Bell's effects, roll all your Bell Dice, plus any extra dice specified by the Bell. Bell Dice always return to your pool. If you roll doubles, roll on the Mishaps table. If you roll triples, roll on the Disasters table. 

You can use your Bells any number of times per day. You can use one Bell per combat round. If anyone untrained in the bells uses them, they automatically roll on the Disasters table, and the bell's usual effects do not occur. The entire set of bells is worth 1,000gp if sold in a major city, but the authorities of the Church will arrive within 24hrs and start burning and torturing anyone involved. If you die while carrying the bells, your companions should bring them to a pious bishop or abbot. You are encouraged to inform your most trustworthy companions of this requirement.

The range listed on the bells assumed clear air above ground. The range can be reduced if muffled by walls or other sounds. Bells affect the closest targets first, but subsequent uses will affect targets further out. They do not affect the Exorcist. You must stop ringing a Bell for 1 round to change effects, or to change Bells. If an effect lists a Save, targets must Save each round the bell is rung.

Ancient undead who have faced Exorcists before may gain a bonus to their Saves, at the GM's discretion.

**Undead Sense**

You can sense embodied undead up to 50' away, even in total darkness. You can sense the approximate number and strength, either as a smell, a sense of pressure, or with an inexplicable Second Sight.

**Name Them**

You automatically know the name of any undead of 7 HD or more. If they are truly ancient and notorious, or if they have returned more than once, you may know their deeds, disposition, and weaknesses. The name may not be their true name; it's the name the Church knows them by. At the at the GM's discretion, you can test Religion to learn details.

**Dual Bells**

You can use two Bells per round. Roll once, using the largest bell's dice pool + 1 BD. You also lose 1 HP each round you use two Bells.

## The Seven Bells

These will be printed on the back of an Exorcist character sheet or given as a handout. Each bell can make a range of musical notes, unlike a conventional handbell.

**Rana, the Sleeper**

The size of a thimble. High, but soft, like a lullaby's first notes.

Adds: -1 BD

Range: 50' 

Effect: Choose one. 

a) A number of embodied undead up, with total HD = [number of Bell Exorcist templates] x4 or less, must Save or become docile and passive for 1d10 minutes. They will not attack unless attacked. After 10 minutes of ringing Rana, any embodied undead of 1 HD or less are banished.

b) A number of living creatures, with total HD = [number of Bell Exorcist templates] x4 or less, must Save or fall asleep. They sleep for 8 hours, and cannot be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap.

**Mosrael, the Waker**

The size of a strawberry. Harsh, tinny, flat.

Adds: 0 BD

Range: 50' 

Effect: Choose one.

a) Cancel the effect of Rana.

b) Wake up all sleeping living creatures.

c) Draw the soul of someone who recently died back to their body. The soul is allowed a Save, with a +1 bonus for each day since death, and a penalty (GM's discretion) if  the death was particularly gruesome, tragic, or unexpected. The corpse cannot move (without the use of Kibeth) or speak (without the use of Dyrim.) It is essentially a paralyzed zombie, capable of moving its eyes but nothing else. This effect persists after Mosrael stops ringing.

**Kibeth, the Walker**

The size of a child's teacup. Many sounds. A merry bell.

Adds: +1 BD

Range: 100' 

Effect: Choose one. 

a) A number of embodied undead, with total HD = [number of Bell Exorcist templates] x4 or less, must Save or move 10' in a direction you chose. You can move them into danger, over cliffs, etc. If you raised them using Mosrael, you can cause them to crudely attack living creatures they encounter.

b) A number of number of living creatures, with total HD = [number of Bell Exorcist templates] x4 or less, must Save or move 10' in a direction you chose. If they would move into danger, they get a new Save to resist the effect and stop just before.

c) All living creatures with 2 HD or less must Save or move by skipping, hopping, waltzing, etc. They can otherwise move freely, but the unnatural dance imposes a -2 penalty to their Defense.

d) All embodied undead gain the ability to walk and move their limbs. This effect persists after Kibeth stops ringing.

**Dyrim, the Speaker**

The size of a pear. Clear, sharp ring.

Range: 200'

Adds: 0 BD

Effects: Choose one. 

a) All sound is muffled within the range of the bell, except for the Dyrim's sound. Speech must be shouted beyond 10' and cannot be heard beyond 20'.

b) A number of noise-making targets = [number of Bell Exorcist templates] are silenced and muted. Unwilling creatures or very noisy targets (bell towers, volcanoes) get a Save. If the target is an embodied undead, it is permanently rendered mute.

c) Target embodied undead gains the ability to speak. It does not have to answer your questions, but it may volunteer information, scream, rant, or require the aid of Saraneth to bind. You can typically get 1d6 coherent answers out of any given corpse of a 1 or 2 HD creature. This effect persists after Dyrim stops ringing.

**Belager, the Thinker**

The size of a clenched fist. A rattling, leaden bell. The sound is selective, rising and falling differently for each listener.

Range: 200'

Adds: +1 BD

Effects: Choose one.

a) All living creatures gain +2 Intelligence, but their thoughts will be morbid and clouded with the cold clarity of death. No romantic poetry, no dangerous schemes, but decent accounting, math, and translation.

b) A number of living creatures, with total HD = [number of Bell Exorcist templates] x4, must Save or forget the details of the last 5 minutes. If you Save vs Intelligence, you can select targets for this spell (instead of selecting the closest targets.) Each round you ring Belager, you can chose to affect more targets or erase another 5 minutes from targets who failed their previous Save.

c) Save vs Intelligence and choose a single target. If you fail, lose 1 HP and take 2 temporary Intelligence damage. If you pass, the target must Save or forget a specific thing or event of your choosing. This can be broad (a child, a crime) or specific (a single poem, a person's face), a but not universal (gravity, the need for food.) Very intelligent creatures can Save again if confronted with evidence that they have forgotten something to remember it again.

d) Save vs Intelligence and choose a single corporeal undead target. If you fail, lose 1 HP and take 2 temporary Intelligence damage. If you pass, the undead regains full memories of its life, along with its former Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma (for the purposes of Saves, etc..)  It may despair at its new condition, it may seek power, it may act as a general or a necromancer. Raise nothing you cannot put down.

**Saraneth, the Binder**

The size of a mug. A deep, low bell. Funereal.

Range: 300'

Adds: +2 BD

Effects: choose one.

a) When you begin ringing Saraneth, chose an amount of HP. Your maximum HP is reduced by that amount. A number of embodied undead (of any HD) equal to that number are bound to your will, and will obey your commands as loyal servants. Powerful undead may Save to negate. This effect persists after you stop ringing Saraneth. If an embodied undead bound in this way is banished or destroyed, you gain the point of maximum HP back (but do not heal any HP.) 

b) Inflict [number of Bell Exorcist templates]xd6 damage to embodied undead, starting with the closest undead. You must banish the closest embodied undead before assigning any damage to the next undead. 

c) A number of living creatures, with total HD = [number of Bell Exorcist templates] x4, must Save or obey the single-word command you speak when you stop ringing Saraneth. The command must be an immediate and feasible action ("run" and "drop" work, "explode" and "die" probably won't.)

d) A single target must Save or answer your questions, telling only the truth, for [number of Bell Exorcist templates] questions after you stop ringing Saraneth.

**Astarael, the Bringer of Sorrows**

The size of a skull. So deep it can only be felt, not heard. A bass thump with a cold edge.

Range: 300'

Adds: N/A. Do not roll if you use this bell. The effect automatically occurs.

Effect:

All undead, embodied or not, are banished. All living creatures capable of blocking their ears must Save or Die. The Exorcist automatically dies (no Save, no tricks.) All spells are cancelled, all enchantments broken, all magical effects ended. Creatures that cannot hear gain a +10 bonus to their Save but must still Save. This bell is rarely, if ever, used. It is the final desperate measure, the one tool an Exorcist is trained to use but hopes never to wield. 

**Mishaps (on a double)**

1. Harsh clap. The Exorcist loses 1 HP.


2. Sour ring. All Saves against the Bell's effect are made with a +4 bonus.


3. Slip. The Exorcist chooses another effect of the same bell. That effect occurs instead. The Exorcist selects the target or targets.


4. Slide. The GM chooses another effect of the same bell. That effect occurs instead. The GM selects the target or targets.


5. Upswing. The Exorcist loses control of the bell for a split second and must Save vs Wisdom or stop ringing.


6. Clatter. The bell's effects do not occur this round. The Exorcists loses 1 HP.

**Disasters (on a triple)**

1. Freedom. The Exorcist loses control of the bell. The GM may choose to have a secondary effect of the bell occur, or alter the bell's current effect in an unpleasant way (to target allies instead of enemies, or empower enemies, or raise something the Exorcist intended to banish.) The Exorcist stops ringing.


2. Sympathy. A randomly determined (1d6, for bells 1-6) bell rings as well, with a randomly determined effect. Could be the same bell with the same effect. The Exorcist loses 1 HP.


3. Dissonance. The Exorist takes [number of Bell Exorcist templates]xd6 damage and must Save or stop ringing.


4. Overpowering. The Exorcist cannot stop ringing. The bell's effect becomes more serious and disconcerting. After 1d6 rounds, they can Save each round to stop ringing with a +1 bonus per HP they choose to spend.


5. Call to the Dead. All undead, embodied or not, within 1 mile are aware of the Exorcist, their position, and their goals. The Exorcist also loses 1 HP. 

6. Rejected. The bell refuses to obey the Exorcist and remains silent. The Exorcist cannot use this bell for 1d6 days. After that, they must Save. If they fail, they can never use the bell again. Rituals of atonement, soul-searching, or desperation can provide a very significant bonus to this Save. The Exorcist also loses 1 HP.

## Mechanical Notes on the Bell Exorcist

Rather than gaining access slowly, like a [Wizard](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-class-wizards.html), the Bell Exorcist gets all the abilities right from day one. They also get all the corresponding dangers. The goal is to use the bells very, very sparingly until you get all 4 templates up to speed, and even then, to rarely use the most powerful bells. The risks of a catastrophic failure is simply too high.
This class is also complicated. To use it effectively, a player needs to be inventive with the use of their abilities, but fully aware of the potential dangers. It's no more complicated than a wizard with 6 detailed spells, but the interaction between them is the main driver of interesting play.
Outside of the Bells, this class relies on the Religion skill and their Undead Sense to act as a scout, tracker, and knowledge source for the party. The bells are a huge and diverse toolkit; giving this class more tools seems excessive. You might have noticed that there's no cool background table. I want to leave Exorcists and their place in society in the hands of the player. Rather than defining tropes and categories, I want the player to tell me how they see Exorcists, or this particular Exorcist, in the setting.

Multiclassing [Monk](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/09/osr-class-monk.html)/Bell Exorcist could work well; this class is potentially quite powerful, but also quite unstable with just one Bell Exorcist template. I'm not sure how a multiclassed Bell Exorcist/Necromancer would look yet because I haven't finished my version of the Necromancer wizard school. I suspect it would be... worrying.



## Sword Exorcist

**built on Base Exorcist class.**

**Starting Equipment:** The Sword of Exorcism

The Church has chosen you to fight Disembodied Undead. You are most effective against ghosts, revenants, and other spirits, visible or invisible. More importantly, you seek the truth. Powerful disembodied undead are born of violent acts, dishonorable deeds, and terrible crimes. To banish them, you *must *know the truth, and you can use the truth against them.

Your calling is dangerous and, in many ways, disreputable. You are constantly visiting scenes of violence and disorder. You sit outside society's laws and codes, judging, condemning, and assisting people in ways the Church cannot officially sanction. You may need to disguise yourself as a peddler, a beggar, or a madman to complete your task.

### Templates

A: The Art of the Sword of Exorcism

B: The Warding Marks

C: Zone of Truth, +1 Attack stat

D: Master of the Art

You gain +2 to Save vs Fear for every Sword Exorcist template you possess. 

**The Art of the Sword of Exorcism**

A short sword in a jeweled wooden scabbard, lacquered and bound with silver. A remarkable weapon, but even more remarkable in the hands of a priest. It feels remarkably heavy and seems to draw the eye. The sword cannot be destroyed or damaged by any mundane effects (fire, acid, impact.) Spells cast with 4 or more MD can *potentially* destroy it. 

In its scabbard, the sword counts as a magic weapon that deals 1d4+Strength bonus damage. It is wielded as a club. 

The sword can only be drawn against a single disembodied undead target. You must name or designate the target, and also meet the following 3 conditions.

1. You must know the target's **Form**. What does it look like? How does it manifest? 
2. You must know the target's **Truth**. How did it come to be? What were the circumstances of its death? Who was involved? 
3. You must know the target's **Reason**. Why does it remain here, among the living? What does it desire?

These are difficult things to determine. A Sword Exorcist must often act as a detective, searching out the truth, interrogating the guilty, or searching for ancient crimes. Minor ghosts, poltergeists, and spirits can be banished just by brandishing the Sword of Unmaking (and smacking them around a few times.) Powerful spirits are not so easily dismissed.

The drawn sword does 4d10 magic damage per round and has a range of 30'. It looks like a roaring flame made from fragments of unreality, an aurora of impossible light and texture. It only affects the targeted disembodied undead, but all undead, even ones normally immune to Fear effects, must Save or flee.

**The Warding Marks**

You use special coins, pieces of parchment, or ribbons to ward an area. The marks can be used in 2 different ways. You an only safely use the marks once per day. If you use them a second time, you automatically drop to 0 HP.

1. Detection. Any disembodied undead passing within 1' of a mark will cause it to change colour, flicker, or glow. An area up to 20'x[Sword Exorcist Templates] in radius can be warded in this way. Invisibility, intangibility, etc. provide no protection. The Marks cannot be fooled.
2. Barrier. An area up to 10'x[Sword Exorcist Templates] in radius is covered in marks. There must be solid surfaces on all sides; this ability will not work outdoors. All doors and windows are warded. Undead on the outside of the marks cannot enter; undead on the inside of the marks cannot leave. If the Sword Exorcist crosses the boundary for any reason the effect ends. This ability also affects spells, scrying, enchanted items, etc. To any spell, spirit, or angel, the barrier is solid. Each hour the barrier is active, you lose 1 HP.

**Zone of Truth**

Your soul is clad in ice. You are unsettling and extremely odd. No one can lie to you about murder. They can evade, they can remain silent, but if they try to speak, they cannot lie... and they feel the weight of their guilt. Every minute spent in conversation with a Sword Exorcist imposes a -1 penalty to Morale.

**Master of the Art**

You have practiced using the Sword of Exorcism. While wielding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Defense. Once per day you can deflect an incoming spell that targets you or the area you are standing in. You can make an Attack roll to swat it back at the caster.
