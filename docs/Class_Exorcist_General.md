### The Body and the Soul

In my setting, spells and souls belong in the same category. If someone curses you, they stick a parasite-thing on your soul. If you are enchanted, your soul might be altered or edited. The soul drives the body and not the other way around. Very powerful and willful creatures like dragons don't[*need* ](http://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-unique-death-conditions.html)a body the same way more fragile creatures do. 

Angels, demons, [summoned entities](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/04/osr-100-entities-you-can-summon.html), creatures created by spells, and some other spirits are pure spell-stuff. Their bodies are just an extension or aspect of their souls.

[Elementals ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/03/osr-what-does-elemental-want.html)are slightly different. As far as anyone can tell, their matter *is* their soul.

### Abominations

An abomination is defined as "that which offends the Authority". The Church recognizes three major categories Abomination as particularly dangerous and, over the centuries, has created special orders and rites to combat them. Not all the examples listed below are abominated by the Church; anything listed as "Also Affects" is just incidental stuff that behaves in the same way, effectively, but which the Church has not specifically abominated. These edge cases might lead to some very weird interactions between Exorcist abilities and the things they encounter. This is intentional.

**Embodied Undead: **Skeletons, zombies, wights, liches, and vampires. Creatures whose bodies died, but whose souls lived on, driving the body. Corpses possessed by a spell or spirit. Also Affects: enchanted weapons, wands, armour, spellbooks, golems and constructs. 

**Incorporeal Undead: **Ghosts, banshees, spectres, and shadows. Creatures whose bodies died, but whose souls lived on and roam freely. Also Affects: spells, angels, summoned demons, summoned entities.

**Possessive Undead: **Demons, powerful ghosts, and some diseases. Creatures whose  original bodies died but whose souls live on in the body of other living creatures. Two souls in the same flesh. Also Affects: persistent spells that affect a living target, curses.
