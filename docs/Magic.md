# Magic Rules

When a wizard's mind expands, it provides more room for understanding nearby spirits. When this happens, whatever spirit the wizard is nearest and capable of understanding (determined by a roll on the caster's school's table) enters their brain. A spirit trapped in a brain that understands it is a spell.

## Identify Items

A caster may spend one round to determine if an item is magical. Spending one hour to Save vs INT will usually learn something more. Very powerful items, unusual items, or cursed items might require library research or laboratory experimentation to identify. 

Cursed items hide their curse. A Caster may realize their knowledge about a cursed item is incomplete.

Potions cannot be identified magically. Small sips provide clues.

## Using magical items

On each use, roll a d6. On a 1,the magic will be gone, drained, or otherwise unusable after it's used one final run time. 

You might think of a way to remove the item which will allow a player to cleverly think of a way to get it back or sacrifice something to keep it.

## Spells

### Spellcasting

#### Casting from Memory

Magic Die (MD) = 1 D6.

[**Dice**]= # Magic Dice (MD) invested. [**sum**]= values rolled.

1. Choose # [dice] to **invest**.

1. **Roll** invested [dice].

1. [Dice] that show **1-3 return** to casting pool.
2. Spells return to their caster after an 8-hour rest.

------



#### Casting from a Scroll or Book

Scroll or page is destroyed and invests one free MD into the spell.  Spells cast this way do not return to their caster. Instead, they search for something to inhabit or a way to manifest themselves. If they can't do this quickly enough, they're expended into the environs as energy and lose their sentience.

#### Consult a Spell

Spell may be expended to allow caster to consult the spell about relevant information instead of regular effect. [sum] = # of turns to allow conversation.

#### Mishaps and Doom

Rolling doubles causes a Mishap. Rolling triples causes a Doom. A character can only ever suffer three Dooms.

### Storing Spells

A caster's **brain** may contain 4 spell slots. Spells remain in a dead caster's brain for one day and may be extracted in a laboratory.

A **spellbook** holds **10** spells.

A **scroll** holds **1** spell, and 3 scrolls fit in 1 Inventory Slot. Acid or fire damage to character = 50% chance to destroy scrolls.

**Any number of spells can be moved** to and from scrolls or spellbooks or wizard's brains in an hour. Spells **cannot be copied**. They are living things, not simply words on a page.
