# Death and Dismemberment 
(Goblin Punch Version 26)

When have 0 HP, roll d20 + excess damage and look up the result on the table.

Natural 1 = Regain 1d6 HP. Gain a cool scar.

5 or less = Prone and Disarmed.

6-15 = Knocked Out. Beaten for 1 day.

16-25 = Dying. Beaten for 1 day. Gain an ugly scar.

26+ = Dead 

**Magical Healing**

Magical Healing always restores your HP from the regular floor of 0 HP, eliminating any Knocked Out or Dying conditions. (A character healed for 3 HP will be left at HP 3.) You remain Beaten, however.

### Scars

No effect beyond the cosmetic. Write them down on the back of your character sheet.

### Beaten

 -2 to Attack rolls.

•             20% spell failure chance.

•             When you roll on the Death Table, add +10 to your result.

### Knocked Out

 At the end of each combat round, make a DC 11 Con check.

–          If you succeed, you wake up. (You are still Prone and Disarmed.)

–          If you roll a natural 1, you lose a point from a random stat. 

•             If anyone spends a standard action tending to you, you wake up.

### Dying

 At the end of each combat round, roll a d20.

–          Natural 1: you lose two points from a random stat.

–          2-9: you lose a point from a random stat.

–          Natural 20: your condition improves to Knocked Out.

–          If you've lost more than two stat points from this injury, you die.

•             Anyone can attempt to stabilize you with a -7 Int check. Once you are stabilized, your condition improves to Knocked Out.

•             Getting dropped to dying is probably going to be at least 3 turns of downtime: one round spent getting out of Dying, one round getting out of Knocked Out, and one round standing up and recovering your dropped sword.
