# Overland Travel

## Navigation (and Getting Lost)

To navigate accurately (without getting lost,) check MOVE with the following changes:

Plain = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]+7 
Mountain, Hill, Forest = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]-5
Desert, Jungle, Swamp = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]-2

Keeping a large landmark in sight can improve or ensure the chances of accurate navigation, according to the referee's decision.

When lost, the party randomly moves to a different hex adjacent to the one intended.

------

> Alternately, the GM can roll 1d6 and consult the Overland Travel Chart to determine whether the party becomes lost. This allows the referee to avoid telling the players that they went the wrong way allowing nothing more than a description the environment they find themselves moving through.

## Overland Travel Chart

When traveling across plains a character may travel as many miles as their movement score in a day, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 6, without gaining FATIGUE. (This is because a hex is typically 6 miles wide. A party cannot partially enter a hex.)

| Party MOVEMENT | Miles per day without FATIGUE | Hexes per day without FATIGUE | Hours per hex |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1-5            | 0                             | 0                             | Cannot travel |
| 6-11           | 6                             | 1                             | 12            |
| 12-17          | 12                            | 2                             | 6             |
| 18-23          | 18                            | 3                             | 4             |
| 24-35          | 24                            | 4                             | 3             |
| 36-71          | 36                            | 6                             | 2             |
| 72             | 72                            | 12                            | 1             |

------

The average party member has a movement of 12. If the slowest party member has a movement of 12, the party may explore 6 miles in 6 hours.
