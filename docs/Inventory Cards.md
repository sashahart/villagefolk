# Inventory Cards

Items are written on blank business cards or index cards. 3 are readied (in hand or belt.) Stack the ones you are not using. This stack is your backpack.

To get an item from the backpack while in combat, roll a d20 and subtract 2 from your roll (minimum result of 1.)You can take any item at or below the result.

Advantages:  Inventory tangibility, quick backpack sorting, and easy passing of items (with notes written on them.)
