## Light Sources, Checks

A Light Source depletes according to die rolls and illuminates an area.

Each turn, roll. If the result is less than four, use a lower die. 

If anything less than a four is rolled on a D4, the light source is depleted. 

Use these steps: D20 -> D12 ->D10 -> D8 -> D6 -> D4 -> depleted.

**Torch**: D8. 20’ bright light, 40' shadows. 5 per one slot.

**Lantern**: D20 (per bottle of lamp oil.) 30’ bright light, 60’ shadows. 

**Candle**: D10. 5’ bright light, 15’ shadows. 10 per 1 slot.

**Flint and tinder** requires 1D4 rounds to ignite a light source.
