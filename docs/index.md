# Modular GLOG

# Contribute!

Please send me a document (preferably a text file written in Markdown) with any section you'd like to add.

I'm especially looking for any of the following:

- Classes always need updating.
- Equipment lists
- Professions tables

## Style

> Formulas and summary notes which are useful if you've already read. These may be copied and pasted onto a GM screen.

Full length explanation.

------

Examples and advice.

## Project Goals

1. A rules document that focuses on quick and easy reference, especially for experienced players.

## To-do

* Create a new professions table.
* Create a death and dismemberment table.
* Fork a set of rules that fits my setting. (This probably won't happen until a lot more of my content is written - maybe a long time from now.)
* The equipment list isn't ready to use.
* The Random Starting Items table is barely even started.
* The advice sections are almost entirely stolen without credit from random places. I think it's great advice, but I need to replace it with my own or with something that is credited.
* The Professions table is just stolen. It needs to be replaced.
