Please send me a document (preferably a text file written in Markdown) with any section you'd like to add.

I'd also love help with anything on the To-do list, below.

For more information, see this [blog post](https://buildingsarepeople.blogspot.com/2018/07/modular-osr-documents-starting-with-glog.html). We're also discussing the project in this [G+ thread](https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBacon/posts/hkBfGBGYoBC).

# Class Templates

# Mission Statement

* A rules document that focuses on quick and easy reference, especially for experienced players.

# To-do

* Make the website look better. CSS stuff. Anyone want to do it?

* Add a bazillion classes.

* The equipment list isn't ready to use.

* The Random Starting Items table is barely even started.

* The advice sections are almost entirely stolen without credit from random places. I think it's great advice, but I need to replace it with something that is credited. They were originally meant just for me and for my players.
