| Lost Crystal, [Jakub Rebelka](https://www.artstation.com/artist/shz) |

**Starting Equipment: **robes, dagger
**Starting Skill: [d3]:** 1. Cultist, 2. Religion, 3. History
**A: **+1 SD, +1 Summon Slot, +2 Entities, Summoning

**B:** +1 SD, +1 Summon Slot, +2 Entities, Powerful Hold

**C:** +1 SD, +1 Summon Slot +2 Entities, Soul Vision

****D**:** +1 SD, +1 Summon Slot, Master Summoner

You gain +1 Summoning Die and +1 Summon Slot for each Summoner template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each.

### Summoning

Summon an Entity by rolling your Summoning Dice. Dice return to your pool and can be used again on a 1-3, but are exhausted for the day on a 4-6. On doubles, a Mishap occurs. On triples, a Doom occurs. You can only summon an Entity once per day, and you can only control a number of entities equal to your Summon Slots at the same time. You can summon an entity for [sum] hours before it vanishes. It takes one round to summon an Entity. You must be able to speak and you cannot be distracted.

Summoned entities sometimes have strange minds.

You require its true name and knowledge of relevant rituals. Seek ancient scrolls and esoteric religious knowledge to discover summonable entities. Unlike Wizard spells, the information does not destroy the media it is written on once it is learned. Summoners guard their knowledge jealously to avoid sharing power. 

**Powerful Hold**

Chose one entity you know how to summon. Instead of [sum] hours, the entity is summoned for [sum]x2 hours. Whenever you gain a level, you may change which entity this ability applies to. 

**Soul Vision**

You can see the souls of living creatures. This allows you to guess the approximate location of invisible creatures. You can also immediately tell if a person is possessed, undead, or a spellcaster. The price for this gift is your connection to others. You permanently lose 1d6 Wisdom (as the constant scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or 1d6 Charisma (as you become callous and jaded.)

**Master Summoner**

Roll for 6 additional Entities.

Alternatively, name an Entity you already control. For as long as you live, the Entity that you name will always remain with you. You do not need to roll to summon it. It still occupies a Summon Slot.

### Mishaps

1. Summon Dice only return to your pool on a 1-2 for the next 24hrs
2. Take 1d6 damage
3. Mute and Blind 1d6 rounds
4. Agony 1d6 rounds
5. Summon has a 1-in-6 chance of vanishing each hour after being summoned
6. Summon is not under your control. Will pursue its own agenda for the duration of the summon. May take on a different form.

### Dooms

1. Vanish for 1d6 hours to a strange world of blinding light and geometric shapes made of clay. Perform strange acts under the light of a thousand stars. 
2. Vanish for 3d6 hours, as above. Return with 0 HP.
3. Vanish permanently.

### Entities

Entities have 10 Attack, 10 Defense, and 10 HP unless otherwise noted. They automatically Save against magic and magic-like effects unless the caster knows their true name, in which case they automatically fail. If an Entity is reduced to 0 HP it vanishes, but it takes no permanent harm. 

The names listed are not their true names. Their true names are very difficult to write and pronounce.

1. Melchior, of Eyes Unblinded

Enters from somewhere not observed by the caster. Appears as a withered old man in fine robes, or a beautiful young woman with no hair. In either form, Melchior will mutter constantly, repeating meaningless phrases or snippets of conversation. As long as Melchior can see the tongue of a creature, it can tell if the creature is lying. It will hiss and lunge at anyone who lies for purely selfish reasons, and will seek to remove their tongue. Melchior will carry items for you and will provide banal and useless advice if asked. Believed to be one of the most powerful Entities. Has 10 Defense and 10 HP unless it wants to have more. 

1. Cantopas, the Grey Mirage

Enters and moves like smoke. Appears as a rippling cloud of grey-white fabric. Sheds light like a candle. An object smaller than an apple given to Cantopas will vanish. Cantopas moves as quickly as an arrow (150 miles per hour), and will bring the object to the location or person you designate, provided it can reach them before vanishing. If it cannot, it will try and drop the item somewhere along the quickest path. If Cantopas descends onto the head of a living creature, the creature must Save or be deafened and blinded for 1 round. Cantopas has 1 HP.

1. Thoriel, who Demands Reverence

Enters with a thunderclap. Appears as two rotating rings of white light, one inside the other, tumbling through the air. The size of a clenched fist. Shakes, as if enraged. Speaks in high-pitched monotone. Up to [dice] times per summon, can demand a single creature it can see "PRAY". The creature must make the sign of the Authority or, the next round, by struck by a 4d6 lightning bolt. Animals of Creation will kneel or bow instead. Can sense the presence of those who have consciously rejected the Church within 100', but cannot sense mindless creatures, undead, or those who were never converted.

1. Rone, the Blade of Love

Enters silently and appears in your hand. A black dagger of stone and grey leather. Cannot speak or see, but can hear very, very well. Creatures injured by Rone feel no pain, only a curious sensation of pressure. If you hold it like a pen and use blood as ink, Rone will write the answers to any questions you ask, provided it has overheard the answers since you summoned it. It could transcribe a conversation in perfect detail or tell you how many people entered a room, what they said, and when they left. If anyone holds Rone against the caster's will, they must Save or take 1d6 damage, and Rone vanishes. If anyone holds Rone with the caster's permission, they must Save. If they fail, each morning they must Save against the desire to hold Rone again.

1. Gornim, Lord of Vermin

Enters on a cloud of flies and biting insects. Appears as statue of a child made of clay. Crude. Gluttonous. Can command vermin to move, assemble, or bring tribute (food.) Any other requests are met with suspicion and peevish demands. If provided with sufficient food (a larder or storeroom), Gormin will call all vermin within [dice] miles to him for a grand feast. 

1. Malrane, the Scholar's Aide

Enters from somewhere not observed by the caster. Appears as a thin, tired young man or woman with wiry hair. Can speak and translate any language, living or dead. Will not speak or translate blasphemies, or prayers to any god but the Authority. Can only offer a literal translation unless reading by the light of the noonday sun, in which case, a full allegorical and contextual translation is prepared. Cannot, or refuses to, write. 

1. Esilan, the Keeper of Hours

Enters in a shower of feathers. Appears as a floating hourglass orbited by wings. Can accurately and precisely measure any time interval it sees. Up to [dice] times per summon, can demand a single creature it can see "AGE". Target creature's age mirrors for [sum] rounds. A 20-year-old creature becomes 2 years old. A 92-year-old creature becomes 29. A 106 year old dragon becomes 601. This cannot directly cause a creature to die or suffer any damage, but it may affect HP or stats. If confronted by blasphemies, glows as bright as a torch.

1. Simpulex, Carnal Bookkeeper

Enters from just behind the caster. Appears as an androgynous humanoid wrapped in a silk ribbon. Is extremely beautiful. If Simpulex touches a creature, it learns the creature's entire sexual history in graphic detail. Will attempt to seduce a suitable target it if not directly observed by the summoner. Uses poetry and flattery. If the target willingly kisses Simpulex, both the target and Simpulex vanish. The target never returns.

1. Bantos, Life-Leech

Enters by squirming up from cracks in the ground. Appears as a smiling man who vaguely resembles the summoner. Creatures touched by Bantos take 1d4 damage per round. Bantos heals 1d4 HP per round. Bantos has a Strength of 16 and does not need to breathe.

1. Hisbic, the Coin Counter

Enters in a puff of greasy smoke. Appears as a squashed and twisted humanoid, with a huge mouth and gut, no neck or eyes, and tiny limbs. Floats and tumbles through the air like a leaf. Will devour any coins given to it. Will regurgitate the coins at the summoner's request, at any point, even if summoned years later. Loves the taste of rare or unusual coins. Will only swallow metal coins, not jewelry, shells, or promissory notes. Can accurately guess the amount of currency a person is carrying at any given time. Can convert 10 gp per hour from one currency to another, in any format. Loathes counterfeiters. 

1. Raspalan, the Urgent Guide

Enters by running in via a door or window. Appears as a thin human with a scraggly beard and no clothes other than sandals. Cannot stop running. Will lead the summoner to any destination they name, provided it can be reached by running at a breakneck pace and leaping over obstacles. Will attempt to warn the summoner of traps, monsters, jumps, spikes, and other hazards in time to allow a Save. If the summoner does not follow or falls behind, Raspalan will still run to the destination and then vanish when not observed. If trapped, manacled, or cornered, will come up with some means of escape that may also benefit the summoner. Cannot be persuaded to run into a battle, but often runs through them accidentally.

1. Gemwick, Spell Tutor

Enters in a shower of sparks. Appears as a red humanoid the size of an acorn. Has a wizard's robe, hat, and staff. If a wizard sacrifices a limb or eye (of their choice), Gemwick will either teach them a new spell or improve (mutate) a spell they already know. Is respectful, but slightly bored of the summoner. Once per day, can summon 1d6 Limb Homonculi (as Apes, with 1HP), which are made from the fused limbs and eyes of wizards he has assisted in the past. The homunculi obey only Gemwick. Gemwick desires magical items, spells, and the shapely limbs of wizards.

1. Banzatoul, the Morphing Chain

Enters with a musical clatter. Appears as a floating ring of chain the size of a barrel, spinning slowly. If a living creature passes through the centre of the chain, it is temporarily randomized. Roll for a random gender, appearance, and new stats (3d6 in order.) The creature's species does not change. A creature can only be changed once per day. When Banzatoul vanishes, the effects end. Arrows fired through Banzatoul have a 50% chance to catch on fire. Spells with an elemental damage type that pass completely through Banzatoul on the way to their target have a 50% chance of changing elemental damage types.

1. Quen, the Truculent Goat

Enters with a clatter of hooves. Appears as a six-legged grey goat. Has an Attack and Defense of 14. Loves to charge things. If Quen charges and hits an enemy of 2 HD or less, the enemy is automatically knocked prone. Any gate or door less than 20' tall or wide and not protected by magic that is charged and hit by Quen bursts open. Quen prefers to charge targets taller than it, targets with horns, or targets that look cheerful. If no targets are designated by the summoner, it has a 50% chance of charging a random target each hour. 

1. Fizby, Friend of the Stars

Enters with a faint hiss and crackle. Appears as a tiny blue sphere the size of a berry. Glows as brightly as a candle. Will move as you direct and follow people or objects. Each hour it is summoned, there is a 10% chance a falling star fragment will strike Fizby, or the area directly above Fizby if not exposed to the sky. Roll 1d6+[dice] for the type of stone summoned. 1. Tiny fragment of cold stone (no damage.) 2-5. Minor stone fragment, 2d6 bludgeoning damage. 6. Minor iron fragment. 2d6 damage but worth [damage]x5gp to wizards or blacksmiths. 7-8. Major stone fragment. 4d6 bludgeoning damage, target must Save or be knocked prone. 9. Major iron fragment. 4d6 damage, 

target must Save or be knocked prone, worth [damage]x5gp to wizards or blacksmiths. 10. Star Core. Everything in a 1 mile radius takes 6d6 fire damage. Everything in a 100' radius is obliterated. The star core is the size of a fist and burns for 2d10 days while slowly evaporating into nothingness. 

1. Doron, the Shield of the Righteous

Enters with a small thunderclap. Appears as a round shield of brass engraved with tightly packed combatants. Can be carried by anyone as a shield (+1 Defense.) If you "sunder" the shield (reducing incoming damage by 1d12), Doron does not break, but instead reveals one of your sins or failings to all present in a disgusted tone. It will present your sins in the least charitable way possible. If you are attacked by an agent of the Authority (a paladin, an angel, etc.), Doron will still defend you but will reveal one sin every round.

1. Astokepolos, Diagnosticator

Enters in a stream of leaves and smoke. Appears as a gnarled walking stick with a serpent wrapped around it. Astokepolos can diagnose one illness per day, no matter how obscure or complex, and offer a cure. Roll 1d6+[dice]. 1. Cure is impossible (decapitation), 2-4. Cure is difficult but possible (the blood of an albino donkey, the tears of a virtuous raven, a stone from a lost temple), 5-6. Cure is possible to achieve shortly (a rare local plant, a particular ritual), 7-8. Cure is trivial (a common plant, a short ritual chant), 9. Cure is instant (a pressure point, a single word), 10. Cure is instant but the target will die in 1d6 days, target is not offered a choice. Any creatures cured with Astokepolos's advice owe their souls, or a portion of them, to him, and he will claim them at death unless prevented. He bears no ill will if prevented provided it is done politely. Astokepolos can also speak to and translate for serpents.

1. Orniel, the Ash Knight

Enters in a cloud of ash. Appears as a suit of charred plate armour, stacked neatly on the ground. Any humanoid who puts on the helmet will be compelled (Save once to immediately remove the helmet) to put on the rest of the armour. If they succeed, they immediately immolate, and the Ash Knight is created. The Ash Knight has Attack 14, Defense 16, and the HP of the person inside the armour. It wields a sword made of smoke and cinders (d8+2 damage, cannot be parried or blocked by shields.) The creature inside the armour can be faintly heard screaming as they burn to death. The Ash Knight loses 1 HP per hour, and disappears when the summon ends. It does not speak, but will obey most commands without hesitation.

1. Weeblen, Blade Tamer

Enters from somewhere not observed by the caster. Appears as a portly man with grey eyes and slightly stained traveling clothes. Can sharpen any blade. Up to [sum] times per summon, can (a) create a sword, dagger, arrow, or axe that lasts for the duration of the summon or one day, whichever is less (b) sharpen a weapon to give it +1 slashing damage until the end of a combat, (c) identify who forged a blade and when or (d) identify when a blade was last used. Weeblen will not fight, but will assist with mundane tasks if given ale or rations.

1. Creston, who Adjudicates

Enters by floating down from above. Appears as a floating stone sphere the size of a cabbage, carved to resemble a stylized human head. Speaks in a booming tone. If two objects, items, values, or issues are presented to Creston, along with a criteria, Creston will judge them. For example, you could ask "Which of these gems is most valuable?", "Which of my friends is most cowardly?" or "Which of these two wines would I enjoy most?" Creston cannot answer questions that are not local and immediate. It cannot answer "Which country will win the war?" or "Which hallway did the King run down?". Creston enjoys finely made handicrafts and loathes cheats and pretenders.

1. Jalpirtan, the First Assassin

Enters from the shadows. A thin woman in black and grey, beautiful, but cold. Speaks in whispers. Once per day, Jalpartian can kill a single mortal target you name, provided you have a piece of the target's hair or flesh, and the target can be reached within the duration of the summon. Jalpirtan will demand an equal sacrifice: a lord for a lord, a peasant for a peasant, or the equivalent value in lives, calculated by some obscure process. Alternatively, she can offer advice in the arts of poison-making, stealth, burglary, and knife-fighting. If the advice is simple and the conversation is pleasant, she may not demand a price, but she might demand the summoner test their new-found knowledge on an arbitrary target. If the summoner provides her with a suitable apprentice (a child under 10 with no living family, who has killed at least one person), Jalpirtan will take the apprentice and provide the summoner with a detailed plan to locate and kill one mortal target of the summoner's choice. 

1. Antrac, the Dark Flame

Enters in a flare of fire. Appears as a floating orb of dark red flame that emits no light. The orb is the size of a horse. Antrac can imitate any voice it has heard while summoned. It can shrink to the size of a marble. The flame causes no damage to living creatures or plants but otherwise burns as a normal fire. 

1. Louchan, the Scythe of Bones

Enters silently, in the caster's hand. Appears as a scythe of bones. Can be wielded with two hands (d6 slashing damage.) Any creatures reduced below 0 HP by the scythe have a 50% chance to crumble to dust and rise as skeletons of appropriate size and HD in 1d6 rounds. The skeletons last for the duration of the summon, and obey whoever holds Louchan. Both Louchan and the skeletons it creates instantly crumble to dust if exposed to sunlight. 

1. Sbendis, Helpful Vermin

Enters by burrowing from beneath the earth. Appears as a thin, flattened, asymetrical crustacean. Speaks in a whistling tone. If you boil and eat Sbendis (which she readily encourages), the delicious broth formed by her body can nourish up to 10 creatures for a day. If you consume her entire body without cooking it, you gain 10 temporary HP for the duration of the summon. Sbendis can burrow into the body of a creature that died no more than 1 minute ago and control its body for up to an hour. She is a very poor mimic and is nearly useless in combat.

1. Hypanian, the Land-Ship

Enters with a ruble of earth. Appears as a stone ship, crudely carved, with stone sails and a stone rudder. Can only be summoned above ground, in an area with solid ground. Will move at 2 miles per hour across land, cutting a furrow that folds behind it. Ignores trees, mountains, hills, elevation, and lava. Treats rivers and glaciers as reefs and islands. Ignores wind as well. Can carry up to 10 people or equivalent goods in moderate discomfort. Hypanian is intelligent and understands commands, but sometimes forgets to warn passengers of danger.

1. Goamloamer, the Warming Beast

Enters with a shuffle and a pop. Appears as a pig-like creature with no face. Gloamloamer is twice the size of a horse, moves as slowly as a person walking, and cannot attack. It has 20 HP, is always hit by melee attacks, and feels no pain. It is very warm. You cannot eat its flesh, but if you sleep next to it, you count as being inside a tent. If you place a healthy egg under the gloamloamer it will hatch in 1/100th the usual time (5hrs for a chicken's egg.) You can put up to 20 eggs under the Gloamloamer at once.

1. Lukian, the Eye of the Gatekeeper

Enters with a trumpet blast. Appears as a grey glass orb the size of a marble, flickering with faint shadows. Hovers and faintly chants hymns. No ghost or demon can willingly come within a 10' radius of Lukian. Any invisible ghosts or demons within 30' are fully revealed in their true form. Lukian can also tell false priests of the Authority from true ones. 

1. Xeriandel, Whose Form is Agony

Enters with a hideous shrieking noise. Appears as a pulsing rift of light the size of a clenched fist.Targets looking at Xeriandel must Save or take 1 damage per round. Even if they Save, targets develop a splitting headache. Xeriandel will always remain within 20' of the caster, passing through walls and barriers if needed. If not given instructions every 10 minutes, will slowly drift towards the summoner's line of sight. If the summoner fallsunconscious with Xeriandel nearby, Xeriandel will descend into the summoner's ear and reduce them to 0HP. 

1. Jentro, the Mirror of Life

Enters by stepping up from the summoner's shadow. Appears as an identical duplicate of summoner, save for some subtle detail, such as eye colour or a missing scar. Will act as directed for the spell's duration, with the caster's stats or 10, whichever is higher. Is intelligent enough to carry out very complex tasks, but has trouble improvising. Cannot deal damage or cast spells, but can appear to do so via illusions. The illusions are always minor and short-lived.

1. Kylon, Discord Manifest

Enters with a clatter of stones. Appears as a dusty stone idol the size of a brick. Up to [sum] times per summon, Kylon can cause two people to Save or disagree on topic they were discussing. The disagreement may be resolved, or it may turn to violence. If the dust from Kylon is rubbed into a book or letter, the text will change to contain veiled insults and contradictions for the duration of the summon. Kylon can hear and speak, butprefers to remain smug and silent.

1. Uziam, the Creeping Death

Enters as a black stain on a surface. The summoner has [sum] minutes to flee the area. After [sum] minutes, a white figure with tar-like hand and footprints will crawl from the stained surface. Uziam will stalk and strangle (Strength 14) any sentient living creatures in the area, starting with those closest to the summoning point. Serious opposition will cause Uziam to vanish and select a new target. Uziam can pass through walls andturn invisible if required. It only targets the fearful, the isolated, and the weak. Uziam cannot enter areas of direct sunlight, but it can extinguish non-magical flames at will, provided it is hunting a target. It will happily hunt and strangle the summoner.

1. Krentos, Knight of Leaves

Enters with a storm of dried leaves. Appears as ancient suit of animated plate armour with branches growing from the joints. The Knight of Leaveshas Attack 14, Defense 16, and HP equal to the hours of the day remaining until sunset (18 to 8, depending on the season.) At night, or if not exposed to sunlight in the past 2 hours, the Knight of Leaves is completely dormant. While active, it will attack any targets you designate. It does not speak. Dryads and tree-creatures will be polite to anyone in the company of the Knight of Leaves.

33*. Enti, Kite of Eyes

Enters with an accompanying host of winds. Appears as a tattered blue kite with painted eyes. In a good wind (not provided), Enti will rise up to 1,000 feet in the air over the course of the summon. While in the air, anyone holding the other end of Enti's kite string and spool will be able to see from Enti's eyes. You can use this ability at any time (to peek around corners or under doors, for example), but Enti is happiest while flying, andmay provide insight into the things it sees while in the air. Anyone holding Enti's string and spool can cast spells through its eyes.

1. Ophinania, Rot Butterfly

Enters with a cloud of stinking air. Appears as an ordinary yellow-grey butterfly. Is invulnerable to harm. Constantly produces an odour so foul thata) no one within 100' can eat unless starving b) food rots or spoils in 1/10th the usual time c) white fabric or paint becomes discoloured and d)creatures with a sense of smell must Save once to enter the area, and once again to enter within 10' of Ophinania. The summoner is immune tothe last effect, but allies are not. The last effect only applies if creatures are volunarily approaching Ophinania. Walking towards a creature does not require them to Save or flee. Ophinania can tell how long a body has been dead, a flower cut, bread left since baking, or any other duration related to rot and spoiling. She will examine up to [sum] items per summon.

1. Banalor, the Light of Creation

Enters with a shimmer of golden light. Appears as floating sphere of golden flame. The sphere sheds light as a torch. Up to [dice] times per summon, Banalor can flare and illuminate, briefly, an area 100' in radius. Sighted creatures in the area who are not aware of Banalor's flare must Save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. The flare temporarily cancels magical darkness, which will re-emerge at 10' per round from its source. Banalor's flare does not have the properties of sunlight, but unholy or unnatural creatures will instinctively flinch from it. Banalor knows a great deal about scripture, hymns, and glassworking.

1. Irukan, the Tick of Wakefulness

Enters by scuttling out from the summoner's sleeve or coat. Appears as blue-white tick the size of a thumb, with three beady black eyes. Once persummon, Irukan can attach himself to a living target. For the duration of the summon, the target cannot be fatigued or knocked unconscious, anddoes not require sleep for 10 hours after the summon ends. Irukan will grow gradually more bloated as the summon progresses. He has 1HP and, if burst, anyone within 10' must Save or fall asleep (as per the *sleep *spell.) Irukan does not like being burst, and will give the summoner nightmares. If Irukan is burst 3 times within a week, he will lay painful (1 damage) eggs in the summoner's blood, and in 1d6 weeks a swarm ofbaby ticks will crawl from the summoner's tear ducts. If kept warm and flattered, Irukan can also purify a creature's blood, allowing a new Save vs Disease or Poison.

1. Thosban, Cloak of Beasts

Enters by falling into the summoner's hands. Appears as thick cloak of mixed furs, crudely sewn. Anyone who puts on the cloak and names a furred, flesh-eating beast they have personally killed transforms into that beast for the duration of the summon. They must Save each hour past the first or let the beast's nature take hold. They can remove the cloak at any time, provided they have Saved for the hour. Thosban provides guttural advice, suggesting mayhem, death, and gorging on flesh.

1. Leticular, Stairway Between Realms

Enters silently, subtly, and nearly invisibly. Appears as a faint stairway of glass, rising either up or down (randomly determined.) The steps appear to be 1' high, but in fact raise anyone stepping on them by 1', 10', 100', 1,000', etc. respectively. By the 5th step up, the air becomes cold. The 6th step  up causes nearly instant death by freezing cold and lack of air. Similarly, if the staircase, leads down, you can descend the first 1', 10', 100', and 1000' safely (though you will emerge into solid rock unless you step off very carefully.) By the 5th step, the air is intolerably warm. Any further, and you are either incinerated by the heat or dragged from the stairs by the guardians of Hell. You can step off the stair at any time, and if you carefully judge your step, emerge at a useful height. 

1. Zantaliar, Lord of War

Enters with a stiff march. Appears as a scowling man in heavy robes. Will consult and advise on any matters of military strategy, from the raiding of a camp to the invasion of a continent. His advice is useful to amateurs but redundant and irritating to experts or those unwilling to grasp therealities of war. He will refuse to assist in tomb-robbing, burglary, or other unsavory acts. His advice is no more than a year behind the cutting edgeof the area or conflict he is examining. Zantaliar will not fight for you, and will occasionally shout advice to your enemies if they seem particularly disorganized.

1. Oswing, the Merchant of Delight

Enters from somewhere unseen by the summoner. Appears as a thin grey-skinned man or woman in a pale blue cloak. Up to [sum] times per h69summon, can touch a willing living creature to transport them to a rapturous ecstasy that lasts [dice]+1d6 hours. Only pain can wake them from their vision. Oswing will demand payment for the visions. At first, the payment will be trivial, but it will quickly escalate to outrageous sums, cruel tasks, or impossible items. The weak-willed, the desperate, or the poetic must Save after the first vision or forever desire another. Oswing will notgive you a share of its payments, but will allow the Summoner to enjoy a 1hr vision, per summon, for free. If paid or flattered, it can tell you what visions its clients enjoyed best.

1. Iescophcos, Arrowhead of Sorrow

Enters in the summoner's pocket or boot. Appears as black stone arrowhead, shiny like glass. If placed on a horizontal surface, the arrowhead will rotate to point at the nearest newborn person, no matter the distance. Newborn, in this case, means within thee days of birth. If Iescophcos is brought within 10' of a newborn, it begins to shake. If plunged into a newborn's heart, two effects will occu**R**: the child's heart will forever beat at a steady, slow pace, and on their sixteenth birthday, they will be compelled to seek out and obey (as a permanent *charm person *spell) whoever held the arrowhead at the time they were wounded. The infant is not otherwise harmed. If attached to an arrow, the arrow deals 1d6+[sum] damage on a successful hit, but the summon immediately ends. Iescophcos speaks a language no one can understand. 

1. Antoban, the Harbinger of Winter

Enters in a storm of freezing air, from a nearby door or window. Appears as a pale white humanoid of the same species and gender as the summoner, but stiff and frozen like a frostbitten corpse. An area 100' in radius around Antoban will always be uncomfortably cold. An area 10' in radius around Antoban will, provided Antoban is not moving, become painfully cold (1d4 cold damage per round, unless creatures are well insulated or immune to arctic temperatures.) Antoban takes half damage from all weapons and spells, but double damage from fire. It can discuss the history of winters in the area, focusing on famine, madness, and murder wherever possible. Ice elementals fear and revere Antoban, but it will not command them for any reason. In battle, it wields a short iron sword (1d6 damage.)

1. Noroyo, the Useless Fish

Enters with a loud plop. Appears as a horse-sized fish with green scales and whiskers. Sits quietly, slowly breathing and looking around. Despite being out of the water, will not die. Noroyo's flesh is edible but tastes foul and vanishes at the end of the summon, possibly with disastrous effects. If summoned in water, Noroyo appears as a stunted pony with short limbs, and swiftly sinks. The main use of Noroyo is summoning it in the air to squash your enemies (inflicting 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a typical summon, Save vs Dex negates.) 

1. Uskip, Protector of the Virtuous

Enters with a ringing sound. Appears as a purple disc of light, floating 2' over the summoner's head. Any objects falling on the caster from above, no matter how heavy, are instantly stopped by the disc. If trapped by a rockfall or avalanche, Uskip will shield the summoner and create a small air space around their body. This will not  help the summoner escape, but will prevent them from being crushed or immediately suffocated. Additionally, for the duration of the summon, the summoner gains a +2 to Save vs Magic. Uskip vanishes if the summoner utters any blasphemies or strikes a priest. 

1. Warlence, the Perpetual Relative

Enters with a shuffle. Appears as a peasant in appropriate local dress, with a rucksack full of rags and rotten onions. Up to [dice] times per summon, Warlence can designate a target who is not aware Warlence is an unnatural creature. The target will treat Warlence as a distant relative. At a minimum, this will involve a simple meal (Warlence is ravenous) and a warm bed for one night. Warlence is happy to go along with any deceptions the summoner suggests, but cannot invent lies on its own. Will carry supplies and assist with other simple activities, but will not fight for you.

1. Loswach, the Universal Chisel  

Enters in the caster's hand. Appears as an iron chisel with a wooden handle. Loswach can separate any two layers. You can use it too separate skin from muscle, gold foil from wood, rust from iron, or bark from a tree. You can't separate things that are not fused, so Loswach couldn't chisel the armour off a warrior or the nose off a statue (at least, not any more than a normal chisel could.) In combat, Loswach counts as a dagger. Loswach cannot speak, but it will carve answers to simple questions into stone, if guided by an idle hand.

1. Benlib, Door of Possibilities

Enters on a nearby wall. Appears as an ordinary wooden door. Will allow [sum] creatures plus the summoner to pass through it, once per summon, and walk through any other door the caster has seen and marked with a tiny symbol. The door must be within [dice] miles, and must not be locked or magically protected. Benlib vanishes after [sum] creatures or spells have passed through it. Non-living objects pass through Benlib normally, appearing at the door the summoner designated.

1. Nauox, Tapestry of Lies

Enters with a thump and cloud of dust. Appears as a rolled up tapestry, 6' by 10', with ornate designs featuring scenes from the summoner's life as well as fictional scenes. All of them are slightly embarrassing to the summoner, but this is only noticeable on very close examination. Nauox can speak and insists it is a flying carpet. It is not. It also insists it can crush anyone wrapped in it. This is also a lie. The tapestry is animated, and can walk (very slowly) on its corners. Though it will claim otherwise, it cannot be harmed by acid, fire, or spells. A solid hit from an arrow or spell will knock it over. 

1. Eb, the Tasting Lizard

Enters around the summoner's neck. Appears as a sleek yellow lizard with a bright blue tongue. Eb can taste poison gas on the air, and provide information about the source of odours, smoke, or fog. Eb always knows the local tides, and will tell you which hour in the day will be most propitious for sailing, fishing, or conceiving children. Eb desires warm stones.

1. Yigmarial, the Soul Cache

Enters with a glimmer of light. Appears as a tiny grey cloth effigy of the summoner, with strange wet-looking eyes. For the duration of the summon, the summoner automatically passes all Saves vs Death. Decapitation or extreme bodily harm will still kill the summoner, but almost everything else will merely knock them unconscious. The effigy has 1HP and, if torn, burnt, or damaged, immediately requires the summoner to Save vs Death, which is not automatically passed (of course.)
