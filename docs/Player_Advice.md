# Player Advice

## What are we doing?

Let's play a game about burgling for treasure. The Game Master (GM) is a referee who will describe the situation and then ask you what you want your character to do. Then your character does what you said. Sometimes there will be a chance for failure and the GM will ask you to roll a d20 to determine success or failure. Only roll when the GM asks you to roll.

### Courtesy

Please be considerate. Please arrive on time, put your phone far from the table, and don't argue about rulings any more than you believe is truly necessary. Discussion of rulings should be saved for the end of the session, when we're not still playing, so the GM can run a better game next time.

## Principles of Looting Murderholes

### Learn when to run

Old school adventures often present deadly encounters that may seem like you’re expected to beat them. Learn to dig into the world's detail to see the relative power of what you’re facing. Don't be afraid to cut your losses. 

Unlike many modern RPGs, your character doesn’t start with much power. Your meager means and abilities at first level encourage lateral thinking to get you out of trouble. And rising to a challenge really means something when lives are on the line. 

### Combat is war, not sport

Don’t expect encounters to be “balanced”. Approach combat with as much trepidation and preparation you would in real-life. Nor are encounters self-contained. Think outside the box, outside the encounter area, outside the dungeon. 

### Dead ends are opportunities

That dead-end hallway may hide a secret door, or maybe there's another passage to investigate. The gargantuan monstrosity in the courtyard? Maybe you can get around it, or negotiate. A recalcitrant noble? Maybe someone knows how to get some leverage. Couldn't pick that iron door? Maybe one of those unidentified potions will help. When your first attempt fails, change tactics - the dead end is just the beginning of your solution.

## Metagame

### Don’t rely on your character sheet

Your characters are going to have some random numbers assigned to them. Sometimes the numbers will be good, and sometimes they'll be bad, and there's not much you can do about it. In this game the numbers aren't that important.

Sometimes, a character will have terrible stats and survive for ages, while a character with brilliant stats dies almost immediately.

Rules and mechanics are only triggered when necessary. To do something, describe your character doing it; if you need to roll anything, the GM will let you know. When presented with a problem, instead of expecting to “use” skills or abilities on it, first look to the environment and investigate the situation by asking the GM questions. Dice are death-dealers. Avoid them.

If you were in a room with a heavy vase in one corner, and you wanted to know what was behind it, what would you do? Probably drag it to the side, right? How would you look for an air current? Lick a finger and hold it up. How would you judge the slope of a floor? Spill a little water on the ground. Engage the fiction of the game world as real. Describe the real actions you take to achieve the effect you're looking for.

You can come up with any plans you want to. In that way the game is like a real world, and the people in it are like real people. Nobody minds too much if you go around smashing pottery and looting houses in a video game, but in this game, that sort of thing has real consequences. Similarly, you can't lure Bowser out of his castle with a delicious meal in the video game because cooking wasn't coded into the game.

Developing and executing a good plan is a vital skill. Be smart. Pay attention. Think your way out of trouble.

### Live your backstory

Don’t put too much work into establishing a back story for your characters. The backstory will show up as you play and make decisions about them. Their likely early death won’t sting quite as much, and the survivors truly have tales to tell, and levels to cherish. 

### Dig into the world

Discard any assumptions about other fantasy worlds, and be curious about the one you’re playing in. Pay attention to details about characters, the environment, social situations, and more. Take notes on them! Make maps of them! Those details can save your life. When you write your notes, write questions for yourself too. What do they eat? Do they have any social rituals? What's that smell? Why is there a breeze in this room? Is there an empty space where a room should be? Information is leverage.

### Play to win, savor loss

Your characters may get turned into frog-people, lose limbs, be stricken by leprosy, turned into stone, cursed to burp up slugs, entombed in the earth for 10,000 years, or just die from being stabbed in the gut by a farmer with a pitchfork. Learn to love the disgusting, horrifying, shocking, surprising, and even disappointing ways your characters are set back.

And remember, through play, your create a story larger than any one character. You will make your mark on the world, be it a misleading arrow scratched into a dungeon wall, or a crater where a city was. The main character is usually the history you're creating, not the history of an individual.

You start at Level 1 again but it's not a big deal. A Level 1 character is just as useful as a Level 4 character almost every way. You'll never be completely outclassed.

### In Character vs Out of Character

You don't have to do silly voices or wear costumes. The main thing, right now, is to remember that your character knows things you don't know, and that you know things your character doesn't know. 

Your character knows things about the world that you, as a player ,don't know. They know how to ride a horse or make poison or identify magic runes. If there's a situation where that applies, I'll just tell you what your character knows. Please ask me if I don't. If I'm not sure, I might make you roll for it or ask you to explain how your character would know about the topic.

Similarly, there are things you know that your characters don't know. We live in a logical age; the characters you're playing don't. They might not even be literate. You aren't afraid of the weather because you understand what weather is. Your characters don't.

You, the player, might know things about other characters or the world that your character doesn't. You might know a secret about another character's past, or the best way to kill a vampire. But remember, your character can only act on knowledge *they* have.

You might want to ask, for example:

"Can I hit him with an arrow at this distance?" "What does the wall taste like?"

"Does my character know anything about basilisks?"

"How much damage does a longsword do if I throw it at someone?"
