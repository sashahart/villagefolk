# Thief

Starting Equipment: leather armor, lockpicks, dagger

Starting Skill: see below. You also gain the Locksmith and Pickpocket skills when you take your first Thief template.

A: Always Prepared, the Heist

B: Sharp as a Knife, Lucky

C: Opportunist

D: Very Lucky, Great Escape

You gain +1 Stealth for each Thief template you possess.

**Always Prepared**

In town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabeled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, donâ€™t cost more than you originally paid, and are available in town. You can put multiple items inside a large Unlabeled Package, including smaller Unlabeled Packages. You can have no more than two Unlabeled Packages at a time.

**The Heist**

Once per 3 days (or once per adventure or dungeon or campaign arc), you can gain 10% bonus XP for any one valuable item you personally stole. It has to pass through your hands, or you have to be the one masterminding the theft. Unguarded or abandoned treasure does not count (unless there are traps.) For example, a gem worth 1,000gp would give you 100 extra XP. If the bonus XP would cause you to 
gain a Level, you instead gain the exact amount needed to gain the level.

**Lucky**

Once per day you can reroll one of your d20 rolls, or a single Skill test.

**Opportunist**

Whenever you get a situational bonus to an Attack roll (surprise, elevation, etc) you deal an additional +1d6 Damage.

**Very Lucky**

You get an additional use of your Lucky ability once per day. An adjacent ally can use one of your rerolls, provided you could have plausibly assisted them.

**Great Escape**

Once per day, you can automatically escape from something that is restraining you and that you could plausibly escape from. This includes grapples, lynchings, and awkward social situations, but not sealed coffins.

6. You worked as a kidnapper, targeting valuable nobles or citizens displaced by the war. Your trade made you many enemies. Start with manacles and 1gp.

Female:

1. You followed your husband or lover to war but returned alone. You picked up a few useful skills along the way and don't intend to return to your former life. Start with a handcart and a second dagger.
2. You were born and raised in a soldier's camp and have never known another life. You fear neither the law nor the Church. Start with 3 wineskins and absolutely shocking language.

4. You know exactly how to slit someone's throat so that they don't make a sound, and six different places to stab someone in the back. When attacking a totally surprised target, add +1 damage.
5. During the siege of your city, you robbed the dead and the dying and escaped with a vast treasure hoard. One of your companions betrayed you and left you for dead. Also, roll at least once on [this table](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2016/02/d100-how-i-was-wronged-by-that-villain.html.) You start with a gem worth 1gp.
6. You saw the war as an opportunity to profit. Start with 1 camp follower. No matter your Estate, you can read and write.

**Farmer**

1. Your lord forced you into a life of unjust service, either on his estates or in a War. You were eventually able to escape. You start with 3 extra rations. Roll on [this table](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2016/02/d100-how-i-was-wronged-by-that-villain.html) to accumulate other wrongs and grievances.
2. You stole something so minor and inconsequential it is hardly worth mentioning, save that the guilt haunts you to this day. d6: 1. candle stub, 2. eggs, 3. loaf of bread, 4. flowers, 5. bit of ribbon, 6. cup of beer. You can steal anything and commit any crime provided it does not resemble the object of your guilt. Gain a +2 Save vs Fear, but Save vs Fear with a -4 penalty if confronted with something that resembles your guilt-causing object.
3. You are the [d10+4]th child of a poor farmer. You needed to leave or risk starvation. Expect [terrible letters from home](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2017/02/d100-terrible-letter-from-home.html.) If all your older siblings die you can inherit the farm.
4. You believe you are cursed. One year, your crops withered, your friends turned against you, your cattle melted, and your house burned down. You were expelled from your village. Start with the ability to sense magic (as a wizard.)
5. While pretending to be an simple farmer, you are in fact the agent of another power. You might work for a noble, a bishop, a cult, or a rich merchant. You can read and write. Instead of the "Farmer" skill, start with the "Spy" skill.

**Frontier**

1. You lived in a [lawless border region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Reivers.) Your lord changed every few years. Castles were demolished and rebuilt. Farms were plundered. Start with a horse and a good eye for the weather.
2. The region where you grew up was so poor iron and worked leather were rarities. Start with a complete ignorance of civilization. Anything more complicated than a saddle fascinates you and marks you as a near-savage. Rather than +10% bonus XP for spending money on purely frivolous things, you gain +15%.
3. You belonged to a clan of [wreckers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_(shipwreck)#.22False_lights.22.) Start with the False Light cantrip (see below) and the ability to swim.
4. You lived among a clan of cattle-thieves, fence-breakers, and rustlers. You can instantly assess the health and market value of any domesticated animal. You are missing two fingers from your left hand, marking you as an outlaw (in whatever region you came from.)
5. You were hired by a village to protect them when their lord could not or would not. If you betrayed the village, start with 1gp (in loose coins and trinkets.) If you helped them, start with 1 extra ration and a goat.
6. You lived in the high wilderness, robbing anyone who passed into your territory. Start with a bow, 20 arrows, and a deep-seated fear of druids.

**Unusual**

You gain the skill listed, not the "Unusual" skill (which isn't a real skill anyway.)

1. You were an apprentice to a wizard, but he considered you talentless and cast you out. Start with 1 random cantrip from a random wizard school and the "Literature" skill. You can read and write.

1. A divine vision commanded you to abandon your past life and roam the world. There is a 1-in-10 chance this divine vision was actually true. Otherwise, it was caused by poor diet, evil spirits, or your own overactive imagination. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill and item listed.

1. The life of an outlaw attracted you for unusual reasons. Start with the "Poet" skill. You can read and write.

1. You were struck by lightning once and survived. Gain a +2 bonus to Charisma when interacting with [water or lightning elementals](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/03/osr-what-does-elemental-want.html.) You have no idea this bonus exists. You may be struck by lightning again, if circumstances permit it. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill and item listed.

1. You committed a terrible crime, but thanks to the intercession of a traveling Paladin, you were exiled instead of being executed. Start with the "Farmer" skill and strong feelings about religion.

1. Theft can never be secure if witnesses remain. Start with the "Poisoner" skill and 3 vials of poison (d6.)

**Cantrip: Wrecker**
You can only learn and cast this cantrip if you were raised in a [wrecker clan](http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Smugglers-Wreckers/.) It does not require any magic dice or other magical aptitude. You can cast it once per night, and only at night, targeting a lantern or torch. Any sentient creature who sees the light of the lantern, at any distance, must Save or believe it is the light of a ship, safe at harbor. If there is no possible reason for the light to come from a ship (you cast it underground, miles from a river), anyone affected may make a new Save every minute. If a creature does not know what a ship is, the spell provides a helpful but deeply confusing mental image. The cantrip ends at dawn or when the light is extinguished.
