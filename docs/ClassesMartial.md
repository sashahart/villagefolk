## Class: Fighter

Starting Equipment: leather armor, sword, bow, 20 arrows

Starting Skill: see below.

A: Parry, +1 attack per round

B: Notches

C: Tricky, +2 Attack stat

D: Impress, Cleave

You gain +1 HP for each Fighter template you possess.

Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12. 

Notches

Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet. 

1. +1 Damage

2. Expanded Critical Range (+1)

3. Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon)

For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

Tricky

You get +2 to Combat Maneuver rolls. Additionally, whenever you attack and get exactly the number you needed, you may make an opposed Dex vs Strength or Dex (whichever is higher.) If you win, you successfully execute a free Combat Maneuver. 

Impress 

Whenever you win a fight against challenging foes, people who don't like you make a new reaction roll with a +4 bonus. This even works on people you just defeated in combat, unless you caused them undeserved or disproportionate harm. Hirelings get a +2  to Morale, or a new Save vs Fear.

Cleave

Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with an attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a target within 5â€™. You can only cleave an number of targets equal to your Level in a single round.

### Who Are You?


You are a probably a member of the [Third Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm.) If you are good at fighting, it's seen as an affront and possibly a threat to the Second Estate. If you are literate, educated, or troublesome it's seen as a threat to the First Estate. In most places it's illegal for you to carry a sword. Your bow is used for hunting and practice. A strong body of archers is invaluable. Everything you do is taxed. You can expect no protection from the courts, no recognition under the law, and no chance of escaping your lot in life. You have a few rights, but they mostly relate to firewood and turnips.

Your lord typically has the right of "[pit ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning-pit)and [gallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dule_tree), [sake and soke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soke_(legal)), [toll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelony), [team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e), and [infangthief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infangthief_and_outfangthief.)". In modern English, "drowning, hanging, finding you, hunting you, charging you for movement or activity, requesting unpaid labour, and executing summary justice". All the linked articles are worth reading. In some circumstances it's illegal to move away from your land.

Permanent national armies don't exist. Armies are raised, fight, and retire when the season ends or the war is over. The only permanent military forces are [disorderly ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_company), as feared as the [plague ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-bring-out-your-dead.html)and nearly as devastating. While knights and lords obsess over warfare and honour, the involvement of the Third Estate is treated as a necessary but disreputable part of a war. Nevertheless, skilled fighting men can be found in any major city, willing to work for pay. They form a new career whose only profession is soldiering. Paying these soldiers requires more taxes.


### Male Fighter

**Starting Skill: **1. Farmer 2. Soldier. 3. Sailor

**Farmer**

1. You were forcibly conscripted, in violation of your few rights, by an unscrupulous lord. Your farm was seized in your absence. You might idly dream of revenge.

2. Your parents were new arrivals to a conquered area. They wanted you to be able to defend yourself against the uprising they feared daily. You start with 1d6 rumours about the local area.

3. You were a street rat or a wilderness child. Your life has been hard and brutal. Instead of a bow, you start with a sling and 20 rocks (half range, fits in a pocket, but otherwise functionally identical.)

4. Your village was so small, isolated, and threatened that, despite the cultural shock, you and 1d6 of your sisters and cousins, were trained in archery and basic swordfighting.

6. You served in court of your lord and observed daily martial training. In exchange for gold or other favours, a sergeant-at-arms amused himself by training you as well, in secret, as a joke. Or so he believed - your ambitions and desire for freedom lead you into the wider world. Gain the "Laundry" skill.

**Soldier**

1. You followed your husband or lover to war but returned alone. With few useful skills, you took up his equipment and rove Creation, surviving as best you can. You start with a hand cart for hauling your possessions (and hidden weapons.)

**Unusual**
You gain the skill listed, not the "Unusual" skill (which isn't a real skill anyway.)

1. Your parents, maddened by grief at the death of their only son, insisted you replace him. You were raised as a boy and were poised to inherit the family farm before you were unmasked and denounced. You can disguise yourself as male with minimal effort. Gain the "Disguise" skill.

2. A wizard trained you as a bet. He tutored you in combat while his noble patroness tutored a man in sewing, dancing, and poetry. He unsurprisingly lost the bet, but you remain on good terms. He gave you a random [minor magical trinket](http://www.occultesque.com/2017/05/1d100-magical-trinkets.html.) Gain the "Courtesy" skill.

3. You claim to be a soldier polymorphed into a woman by a spell or curse. You have a certified letter from famous, distant wizard to prove it. 10% chance this is actually true. Gain the "Law" skill and 1 camp follower (who will solemnly attest to your transformation, even if bribed.)

4. You were taken as a squire by a [d4] 1. lecherous 2. extremely poor 3. extremely nearsighted, 4. eccentric low-status knight. He was recently killed in battle, and you feared that the persistent rumours would become questions and possibly a trial. Gain the "Horsemanship" skill.

5. You were raised in an outlaw family and know nothing of polite society. Your manners are shocking. You start with a dagger, the "Highwayman" skill, and the ability to shock any member of the First or Second estates with just a few words.

6. You were raised in Foreign Parts, brought to Around Here as a captive or curiosity, earned your freedom, and now seek your fortune. You never liked Foreign Parts much anyway. You start with an appearance and native language so unusual that, to most people, your profession is the second most shocking thing about you. This could be extremely minor (hair colour, accent, pointed shoes.) (Yes, this still applies in a game with toadlings and wizards. At least they're *our *toadlings and wizards, not like those nasty foreign ones.) You gain the "Foreign Parts" skill. Make up 1d6 ludicrous lies.

## Paladin of the Word

[Adapted from Goblin Punch](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/06/god-throat-paladins.html) (as usual.)

From time to time, [the Authority](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/04/osr-religion-in-elderstone.html) needs to make edits to Creation. [Angels](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-creature-paradox-angels.html) are unsubtle and require special conditions to manifest. Paladins are agents of the Authority, but they rarely have direct divine guidance. The Authority steers their lives with subtle practice. Everything a Paladin does, by necessity, is divinely mandate. A Paladin, by definition, cannot act against the Authority - cannot sin - without breaking their vows.

This makes the Church very, very nervous. Paladins put everything in perspective. They are blessedly rare, thankfully aloof, and extremely humble. Official Church doctrine neither exalts nor condemns the Paladins. It prefers to ignore them. 

### Class: Paladin of the Word

Starting Equipment: chainmail, sword, holy icon 

A: +1 MD, No Voice, The Divine Word, +4 to Save vs. Sound 

B: +1 MD 

C: +1 MD

D: +1 MD, The Shout

You gain +2 to Save vs Mind Altering Effects (charm, sleep, mind control) for each Paladin template you possess.

### No Voice

Your pledge to give up your voice was accepted. Your voice is gone. You cannot speak.

### The Divine Word

You have spell-like abilities, but they are not the same as a Wizardâ€™s spells. You do not prepare spells, you cannot read scrolls or spellbooks, and you cannot write down any of the "spells" you know. Otherwise, you generate and use Magic Dice (MD) as a Wizard. You do not generate Mishaps or Dooms.

With one Paladin template, you can cast *command.* You can only target people who speak your language.

With two Paladin templates, you can cast *ventriloquism. *Your *command* ability can target creatures who do not share a language with you. 

With three Paladin templates, you can cast *shatter. *Your *command *ability can target all things, even inanimate objects. You could command a tree to give you its fruit or a grave to exhume a corpse.

When you use *command*, you speak with the Authority's voice. The words speak directly to the nature of matter. It works on the deaf or in a total vacuum. 

**Bonuses**

If you know the creature's true name, it gets -4 on its Save. 

If you have gone at least a full day without using *command*, your target gets -2 to their Save. A full week, a full month, a full year, a full three years, and a full decade each give the target a cumulative -2 to their Save.

If you have gone at least three days without speaking or using *command*, you get a free +1 MD to spend on the command that you are currently casting. 

### The Shout

You begin to proclaim the Word of the Authority. Your lips will rip and bleed from the shockwave. You will be partially deaf for two days afterwards. Each round, you deal 2d6 sonic damage in a 50' cone in front of you, and take 1d6 damage. If you wish to end the Shout, you can Save at the beginning of your turn. While shouting, you cannot move or be moved, but can still fall.

### Mechanical Notes on the Paladin of the Word

This class has a huge and annoying restriction. You can't speak. This might not seem like a major limitation, but in an RPG, especially one based on exploration, communication, and planning, it can be a problem, especially for new players.

This class is also based on the clever use of one spell - *command. *The Paladin class is very powerful. It can outright solve many, many OSR problems. *Command *glass to melt. *Command *poison to flee. *Command *water to support your weight or to drag a boat to the bottom of the sea. You are also a semi-decent fighter because you start with a sword and leather armour. You will also level faster than most characters because you are expected to spend money on purely frivolous things (like donations.)

A word of caution; a poorly phrased *command* can have unexpected effects. Commanding a dying man to *LIVE*, in the voice of the Authority, might cause more problems than it solves. 

### Abilities

**Command **

R: 50' T: person D: [dice] hours 

Target: 1 person that can hear and understand you.

You shout a single-word command to your target, who must Save or obey. If the command lasts more than a single round, the target gets a new save at the beginning of each of its rounds. You can spend additional [dice] to increase the effects.

+1 MD: Affect +2 targets.

+1 MD: You may increase then length of your command by +2 words.

+1 MD: You may increase the duration between checks by +2 rounds. 

**Ventriloquism**

R: 50' T: creature or object that could make noise D: [sum] rounds

Target creature or object speaks for you. The target has to be capable of making a noise. You could target a door (hinges), but not a stone wall or an iron ingot. The voice is clearly unnatural or strained, but it's the object speaking, not you. Your voice is gone. If you target a river, the voice will be burbling, noisy, and foamy. If you target a person, the voice will sound [strange, distorted, and distant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOPSgl9RA70)

**Shatter **

R: 50' T: creature or object D: 0

Target take [sum] force damage. If the target is made of inflexible material, such as stone or glass, the target takes [sum]x2 damage instead. Save for half damage. This represents any *command* that deals direct damage (*explode, die, split, tear yourself to shreds, *etc.)

Instead of adding a MD to the [sum] of this spell, you can instead assign an MD to increase the number of targets by +2. The remaining [sum] damage is split as evenly as possible between them.

### Who Are You?

Paladins are not members of the [First Estate](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html), although they probably[ think like members of the First Estate](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/09/thinking-medieval-first-estate.html.) They are Outlaws - outside of the Estates entirely. You pass through the world like a stagehand wandering onto the set of a play.Your chainmail and sword were given to you for protection; the Authority protects, but a good sword is very useful too. 

You are expected to obey the Authority's laws and mortal laws as well. You have no use for money, save as a tool to help those in need. Give it away, throw it in the sea, or spend it to help the poor and the oppressed. You are expected to seek Justice, love Kindness, and walk Humbly. There's no set point where you'll lose your powers for acting against the Authority's laws. If you're in doubt, that's probably a warning sign. You cannot lose your faith - it would be like a mechanic losing faith in gasoline.

**Starting Skill: **1. History, 2. Wilderness, 3. Unusual

**History**

1. You were trained in a distant monastery, chosen from birth to take up the Paladin's role. You have no hair, beard, or moustache (although you still have eyebrows if you want them.)

2. You read Saints tales until you nearly went mad. You can identify any icon or picture of a Saint instantly.

3. You memorized tales of hubris, lost civilizations, ambition, and folly. You start with a gold ring worth 2gp, shaped like a broken crown.

4. You were trained to recognize the characteristics of leaders. You know the Charisma of any character you talk to (as a vague, yet quantifiable feeling.) You also know the numerical result (but not the effect) of any roll on the Hireling Quality Table.

5. You are trained to investigate and uncover the truth, by study as well as by divine intervention. Start with the Investigate skill and the ability to waggle your eyebrows.

6. You illustrated manuscripts. You can produce beautiful and detailed drawings on demand. Start with ink, a pen, and a quill.

**Wilderness**

1. You were a hermit for many years. Save vs Fear when presented with a crowd or another busy social scene unless you've had time to prepare yourself. You do not require water to survive.

2. Choose one type of weather (desert heat, rain, snow, etc..) You are immune to fatigue from that type of weather. It avoids you completely.

3. You can march indefinitely, without rations or water, provided you do not stop. If and when you stop, even to ask for directions or avoid an obstacle, you gain fatigue to fill up all remaining inventory slots +1.

4. Once per week, you can cast *speak with animals. *You can't actually speak to them (unless you use *ventriloquism*,) but they will clearly understand your gestures and intent, and you can understand what they say to you. Pious animals will also obey you.

5. You were struck by lightning. You have [a very strange scar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure) and you are slightly deaf in one ear. You are also completely immune to lightning damage.

6. You are a natural wanderer, on the road from the day of your birth. You can walk with bare feet as if you were wearing thick boots. You cannot read, write, or understand complex math. 

****

**Unusual**You gain the skill listed, and not the "Unusual" skill.

1. Your appearance is unremarkable in every way. You will be overlooked in a crowd. You aren't any more stealthy than other people. You might be a little old grandmother, a shy urchin, or a vacant-eyed peasant. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html.)

2. War is your profession. You can handle any weapon, from swords to crossbows to laser rifles from an alternate dimension.

3. You are from Foreign Parts, and you look like it. Start with the Foreign Parts skill and an outrageous costume.

4. You are so pious that spells and other magical effects turn away from you. Any harmful spell that targets you directly, and that you Save to negate or avoid, has a 1-in-6 chance of rebounding onto the caster. Start with the Religion skill. 

5. You have attracted a small group of followers or an accidental assistant. Start with 1d4 [Camp Followers](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html) and the Warfare skill.

6. You have trained in the art of the use of a subtler kind of voice. You can whisper your *command*, instead of shouting it, by spending +1 MD. Start with the Poetry skill.





## Barbarian

Starting Equipment: heavy weapon, leather armour

Starting Skill: Foreign Parts. Also, see below.

A: Rage

B: Danger Sense, A Taste of Home

C: Feat of Strength, Die Hard

D: Tough

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess. You get +1 Stealth if you possess 2 Barbarian templates.  

**Rage **

You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. While in a rage, you have +1 Attack stat, all your melee attacks inflict +1 damage, and are immune to pain and fear. You might froth, or stare in battle-focus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

While raging, you cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things. Spellcasting is not impossible, but all your spells must be damaging spells, which deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets.) Mishaps and Dooms may be more severe. While raging, you cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. You can will yourself to stop raging with a 2-in-6 chance of success at the start of your turn as a free action. If one of your allies has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

**Danger Sense **

If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act on the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can roll under your Intelligence to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.

**A Taste of Home**

You can consume a special ration to regain 1d6+1 HP. This takes 1 round. Examples: an [alcoholic drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvavit), a strange fruit or [vegetable](https://youtu.be/3JNt3EpCJZU?t=902), an unusual[herb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khat.) One use costs 1gp and can be purchased in any trading city. 3 "doses" fit in a single inventory slot. You cannot do this while raging, but you can immediately enter a rage after eating the ration. If you have any Lethal Damage, you instead heal to 0 HP. If an ally waves the ration under you nose, you can Save vs Constitution to wake up. You may play a theme tune (or a *leitmotif*, if you're classy.)

**Feat of Strength **

Once per day as a free action, you have 22 Strength for 1 round. Can also be used in combat (your Strength Bonus is 4.) 

**Die Hard**

You have 4 rounds to remove all your [Fatal Wounds](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-death-and-dismemberment-table-early.html?showComment=1500610863104#c5538797767091825435), rather than 3.

**Tough**

 Reduce all incoming damage by 1 point. You gain a +2 to Save vs mind-altering spells.

### Mechanical Notes on the Barbarian

Fighters are all about damage output. Knights are tanks with high defense and the ability to attract attention. Barbarians soak damage instead. They have high HP and the ability to heal in combat. They also usually go first. with a side ability of "knowing really obscure stuff." Rather than oiled-up illiterate goons, Barbarians can come from many backgrounds and use many skills. The generic feudal setting I'm using is based on 10th-14th century France, England, and Germany. Barbarians could be based on almost any other "foreign" culture, from Scotland to Syria to Mongolia to even more unlikely locations. The core of a Barbarian might be their ability to fight, but the real advantage is their association with the unknown.

### Starting Skill

1. Mountaineer, 2. Raider, 3. Horses, 4. Soldier, 5. Sailor, 6. Unusual

You are from Foreign Parts. The language of the people Around Here is strange to you; their customs are unusual and sometimes amusing. You might worship the Authority as they do, but you might also be from a heretical sect or a pagan. Unless your background states otherwise, you can a start as a member of the First or Third Estates, or as an Outlaw. Barbarians can be male or female; they do things differently in Foreign Parts. To a certain extent you bring your own laws and customs with you.

**Mountaineer**

You cannot wear chain armour or plate armour.

1. You lived in the high alpine passes. When you weren't farming goats you were feuding with your neighbors. Start with 1 goat and a set of winter clothes. 

2. You were a prince of a great nation who lived in valleys between mountains that cut through the clouds. You are innately superior, and know how to behave like a noble. Gain the "Courtesy" skill, 1gp, and the starting [Noble Rank ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html)of 1 with an upkeep of 12gp/month. Your clothes were fancy in your homeland.

3. You were a great skirmisher and high-pass fighter. Start with 50' of rope, a grappling hook, and a weather-worn face.

4. You lived in the back of a great glacier or on a trackless snowfield in the north. Start with a pair of bone [snow goggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_goggles.) Each morning, if you wake up above ground, you can Save vs Wisdom to tell what the weather will be like that day.

5. You are a mercenary and a guide. Sometimes, you lead armies to their death. Sometimes, you lead them through impossible terrain. Start with 1d10sp and a spare sword.

6. You searched the mountains for rare beasts. Start with fur robes worth 50gp that you wouldn't sell even if threatened with a horrible death. You killed the animal yourself. Feel free to a name and describe it.

**Raider**

You cannot wear plate armour.

1. You were part of a mercenary army, brought here to fight a conflict and shattered by the result. You do not know the way home. Start with a horse and a shield.

2. Your appearance is so outlandish even educated and well-traveled people will stop to stare at you. The difference might be minor to modern eyes. You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma in situations where your novel appearance or dress might provoke interest (court, seduction) and a -2 penalty to Charisma when it would cause fear or discomfort (peasant gatherings, church services.)

3. Your culture rewards death in battle against impossible odds. You must Save to retreat from a fight. You may reroll a failed Save vs Fear if your immediate response, if you succeed, is to rage and charge.

4. You were an expert looter, raiding caravans, cities, and travellers alike. Start with brightly coloured clothes made from the torn silks of your enemies.You can evaluate the worth of looted treasure (as a Thief.)

5. You know how to frighten the weak-willed and inexperienced. Start with a pot of war paint. It takes you an entire round to enter a rage, and you must spend that round [chanting, dancing,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haka) or [displaying your weapons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw.) You can maintain this pre-battle rage-chant for as many rounds as you need to without attacking. This may force your enemies to make a Morale check or Save vs Fear. 

6. You are an expert slave-catcher. If you make a Combat Manuver and grapple a human-sized target, you can also disarm them.

**Horses**

You cannot wear plate armour.

1. You are completely at ease in the saddle of a horse. You start with a bow and 20 arrows, but no horse (it died recently, and you need to earn enough to buy a new one.)

2. You have a riding animal of an unusual breed (a six-legged horse, a camel, a giant centipede, a huge bird.)

Items on this list cost 1gp per serving and are only available in major trading cities. People from Foreign Parts buy them to remind themselves of home; everyone else think the items listed are disgusting, confusing, or a complete waste of time.

| 1d100                |                         |                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Meat**             |                         |                                          |
| 1                    | Hanging meat.           | Salt it, flatten it, leave it to air-dry until it falls apart. Really tough, a little green around the edges. |
| 2                    | Pickled eyeballs.       | Mostly flavorless, slightly greasy, hard to explain to visitors. |
| 3                    | Dried eel.              | Leathery. Smells like wet dog.           |
| 4                    | Weird bit.              | The tendon from the left leg. The wattle. The gizzard. Something you wouldn't normally eat. |
| 5                    | Blended organ sack.     | A stomach filled with other bits of animal and special spices, left to ferment. |
| 6                    | Rotting fish.           | Has to be a very specific kind of fish. Carried in glass bottles. Smells like death. |
| 7                    | Dried crickets.         | Served in honey. Well attested in holy books; less appealing these days. |
| 8                    | Fermented crab.         | PC swears it's an aphrodisiac; everyone else thinks the smell is off-putting. |
| 9                    | Dried meat.             | Mashed with fat and berries and dried in strips. Tastes like the bottom of a gardener's boot. |
| 10                   | Mashed stoat.           | Minty fresh for some reason.             |

| 11                   | Baked rat.              | Except it's not a local rat. It's some kind of smug-looking foreign rat. |
| 12                   | Pig grease.             | The leftovers from a thousand plates of fried pork. Crunchy. Kept in a jar. |
| 13                   | Mashed ants.            | Lured out by the PC and cooked in a pot, then mixed with grain. Terrifyingly awful. |
| 14                   | Whole songbird.         | Would be fine, but it's coated in some sort of black foul-smelling paste. |
| 15                   | Fermented bird.         | Store it in a sack then drink whatever drips out. Absolutely awful. |
| 16                   | Dried lizards.          | Tiny. Eat a handful at a time. Crunchy but extremely dry. |
| 17                   | Rabbit ears.            | Why the ears? And why eat them with the fur still on? |
| 18                   | Sea thing.              | Horrible little sea insect. Too many legs, bright pink, baked then preserved in red sauce. |

| 21                   | Eggs, cooked.           | Boiled in something unpleasant, left to dry in the sun. Tastes like battery acid. |
| 22                   | Eggs, fermented.        | Buried in clay for a month. Sulphrous, crumbly. |
| 23                   | Eggs, mashed.           | Mixed with some horrible root. Smells like burnt meat. |
| 24                   | Eggs, candied.          | Put in an urn with weird roots. Crystallized, snaps like glass, tastes like hair. |
| 25                   | Eggs, fish.             | Lots of little tiny ones, black like stones. Briny, unpleasant aftertaste. |

| 27                   | Eggs, lumpy.            | From a bird with the hiccoughs, maybe. Bulges. Tastes like milk. |
| 28                   | Eggs, snail.            | Pickled in brine. Thin shell, tastes like mushrooms, slight worries of snails hatching inside you. |
| 29                   | Eggs, sea.              | Not sure if they are from a plant or a fish. Large, green, briny pouches. |
| 30                   | Eggs, exotic.           | Blue and green with stripes. From somewhere in the mountains. Watery and sulphrous. |
| **Strong Drink**     |                         |                                          |
| 31                   | Horrible herbal liquor. | Sold in tiny glass bottles, vaguely greasy taste. |
| 32                   | Blessed water.          | Blessed by a particular saint or god. The PC can taste the difference. |
| 33                   | Green infusion.         | Apparently made by monks. These monks must be real sick bastards. |
| 34                   | Brown liquor.           | Very strong, made by alchemists, dries out your throat. |
| 35                   | Honey beer.             | Comes in clay pots. Delicious but distinctly foreign. |
| 36                   | Fermented cloves.       | More of a mash than a drink. Will make your earwax run. |
| 37                   | Red liquor.             | Thick like treacle, tastes like fruit, but makes everyone but the PC throw up 10 mins later. |
| 38                   | Bitter leaves.          | Make a horrible medicinal drink if soaked in boiling water. The PC eats them raw in emergencies. |

| 40                   | Buttery wine.           | Not made from grapes, that's for sure. Strong, but kind of slimy. Starchy flavour. |
| **Root Vegetables**  |                         |                                          |
| 41                   | Fat purple turnips.     | Kind of tasty if cooked, but the PC insists on eating them raw. |
| 42                   | Long grey carrots.      | Very very spicy.                         |
| 43                   | Rock-like vegetable.    | Devoured raw, leaks milk. Utterly disgusting. |
| 44                   | Round green lumps.      | Some kind of nut? No one is sure. Incredibly bitter aftertaste. |
| 45                   | Thin white roots.       | Served by the handful. Faint smell of cut hay. |
| 46                   | Corkscrew turnips.      | Worse than regular turnips in every way, from appearance to texture to cost. |
| 47                   | Fat white root.         | Like an obsese carrot, but it tastes like sweat. When dried it starts to fall apart. |
| 48                   | Horrible onion.         | Red, not yellow, and sharply acidic. The devil's onions. |
| 49                   | Lumpy root.             | Shaped like a deformed person or a sick animal. Orange and fibrous, strong flavour. Chewed. |
| 50                   | Hairy yellow root.      | From a flower. Tastes like vinegar, but it keeps away insects. |
| **Leafy Vegetables** |                         |                                          |
| 51                   | Broad green leaves.     | Opens the pupils, increases the heart rate, makes the PC talk very quickly. |
| 52                   | Diamond leaves.         | Tingly, stains the teeth green, fairly mild flavour. |
| 53                   | Small grey leaves.      | Ashy. Sold by apothecaries. Strong hallucinogen, PC is immune. |
| 54                   | Stringy frayed leaves.  | Tastes like soap. PC insists it does not taste like soap. |
| 55                   | Flat green leaves.      | Bitter, watery. Slowly rot into a dripping mass that is still, somehow, edible. |
| 56                   | Fern leaves.            | Taste like grass, but with runny sap. Stains the teeth green. |
| 57                   | Orange leaves.          | Dried and crispy. Crushed up and held under the tongue. Makes the PC sleepy an hour later. |
| 58                   | Little round leaves.    | Tastes like copper and makes everyone but the PC sneeze uncontrollably. |
| 59                   | Veiny lumpy leaves.     | Bitter and horribly chewy. Like eating a sheet of lead. |
| 60                   | Curled-up leaves.       | Little balls of green, swallowed whole. Gives everyone but the PC gas. |
| **Bread**            |                         |                                          |
| 61                   | Hard cakes.             | Why would anyone do that to bread? So dense they hurt your teeth. |
| 62                   | Drip cakes.             | Bread thrown into boiling fat. Extremely weird. |
| 63                   | Spice bread.            | A pinch of spice from Foreign Parts. Tastes like leather. |
| 64                   | Rolled bread.           | Layered meat and cheese inside bread. Looks appetizing, but the spices used are very unusual. |
| 65                   | Yellow bread.           | Made from some some grain from Foreign Parts. Gritty. |
| 66                   | Corpse bread.           | Like bread that's been left to die. So stale, so crunchy. Squeaks when you eat it. |
| 67                   | Hole bread.             | The baker must be mad because it's full of air and holes! |

| 69                   | Incompetent bread.      | Strange flour and water cooked in a pan. Makes a round puffy thing. Goes stale immediately. |
| 70                   | Round bread.            | Spheres of dough with meat and yellow spices inside. The spices are very strong. |
| **Cheese**           |                         |                                          |
| 71                   | Blue-black cheese.      | Wrapped in the stomach lining of a goat. Smells awful, causes birds to fall from the sky. |
| 72                   | White lumpy cheese.     | In a wineskin. Acidic, but fairly tasty on bread. PC insists it pairs well with fruit. |

| 76                   | Grey hard cheese.       | Thick rind, smells like a cow dying of starvation. Kept coated in wax. |
| 77                   | Monk cheese.            | Made with milk from blessed cows and covered in the remains of holy candles. No real taste. |

| 79                   | Soft white cheese.      | Served in clay jars. Sweet, but causes gastric disasters in anyone but the PC. |
| 80                   | Meat cheese.            | The PC insists on making it with things from the ocean and not pork or beef trimmings. |
| **Mushrooms**        |                         |                                          |

| 85                   | Round grey mushroom.    | Deadly to dogs and cattle, but the PC swears it's fine to eat. Tastes like old beef stew. |

| 88                   | Brown plate mushroom.   | Grows on the side of trees, apparently. Like eating a soggy plank of wood. |

| 92                   | White beans.            | Like pebbles, but chewy. After a few minutes your tongue goes numb. |
| 93                   | Red beans.              | Taste metallic, deeply unpleasant. Apparently very good for you in large quantities. |
| 94                   | Horrible sea thing.     | Orange. Looks like a deflated penis. Probably tastes like a deflated penis. |
| 95                   | Pointy red fruit.       | Full of seeds. Burns like fire, makes your eyes water, and gets all over your hands. |

| 98                   | Pink salt.              | From the mountains. Apparently heals you and makes your hair grow. Just tastes like salt. |
