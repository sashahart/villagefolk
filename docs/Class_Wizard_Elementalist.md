# Elementalist Wizard

Elementalist Wizards speak to and rely on elemental spirits. They are a wild bunch, disreputable and windblown. In rural areas, they are beloved as rain-bringers and flood-calmers, but they are also run out of town or hung following forest fires and earthquakes. 

**Perk:** +3 to Save or Defense vs Elemental damage. No bonus against non-damaging effects.

**Drawback**: Cannot cast fire spells if wet. Cannot cast water or ice spells if dehydrated. Cannot cast earth or acid spells if you are not touching the ground. Cannot cast air or lightning spells if you do not have line of sight to the sky. 

**Cantrips: **

1. You gain Elemental Vision for 1 hour by meditating for 1 hour. 

> You can sense the potency and disposition of any nearby elemental spirits. The ground appears to be made of interlinked stone bodies. A campfire is a jolly spirit devouring logs. Clouds appear as fat naked people rolling through the sky. You can speak to the spirits - you always could, anyone can - but when you are attuned like this, they are more inclined to listen. They won't obey you, and they may be hostile, but they may also offer advice, tell tales, demand offerings, or simply ignore you. 

1. Summon a flame the size of a candle's by snapping your fingers. Cannot be used to deal damage. Only exists for a few moments but may be used to start a fire. Range: 10'.
2. Meditate for 1 hour to gain a new Save against any poison or choose another damaging effect.

**Mishaps: **

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
2. Take 1d6 damage 
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a save. Permanent if you fail. 
4. Soaked, or dehydrated, or flung upwards, or buried. 
5. Deafened for 1d6 rounds 
6. Wild elemental spirits flee your body for 1d6 rounds. Everyone within line of sight must Save each round or be stunned

**Doom of the Elementalist:**

1. Take sufficient elemental damage to reduce you to zero HP. 
2. Each time you cast an Elemental spell, Save or the spell flies out of control. If it likes you, the effects might not be too bad. The longer it's been sitting around un-cast, the less it likes you.
3. The elements turn against you. Expect 1d4+4 powerful spirits to arrive shortly. In the meantime, fire chases you, stones seek to crush you, the earth trembles, and lightning bolts plunge from the sky.

This doom can be avoided by journeying to a powerful elemental centre and pledging yourself to the spirit within, or by visiting pure vacuum or the deepest shadow. Shadow and vacuum can cut the ties that let elementals identify you.

### Spell List:

Elementalists are very close to their spells. They name them and treat them like pets. It's possible that your spells breed, or age. Maybe your *circle of frost* spell is carried by the children or slaves of your *wall of ice *spell.

For spells with [element] listed, you can choose the element. If you'd generate a duplicate of a spell with the [element] tag as you gain Wizard templates, you may either reroll the spell, or choose a different element. There's no rule that says you have to be consistent in your element choices, but it will probably happen naturally.

> 1. Circle of Frost
>    R: self T: [dice]x10’ radius D: 3 rounds 
>      All creatures in area take 1d4 damage, Save vs Reflex for half. Everything that fails its Save is frozen to whatever surface they were touching. Boots are frozen to the ground, keys are frozen in their locks. Creatures are usually immobilized from the boots down unless they were playing in a fountain or something. Attempting to break loose is a free action that can be attempted once per round, and requires a successful opposed Strength test. The ice has a Strength of 10 + [dice]x2.

> 1. Control [Element] (Elemental) Pick one of the following elements. Control Rain is a bit of an odd exception, but it was too good not to include in this list. I'd say the effects increase more or less exponentially. At 4 [dice], Control Earth should let you dig a moat or build a hill, like a proper crazy wizard. Control Air at 4 [dice], could push a small fleet of ships, or summon up the North Wind itself to freeze an army.

> Control Air  
> R: 50’ T: a gust of wind D: concentration 
> Control a gust of wind within 50'. At one [die], use wind to (a) clear away fog or gas, (b) extinguish a fire no larger than a torch, (c) blow all the papers off a desk, (d) with concentration, provide enough of a breeze to power a tiny sailboat. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects.   



> Control Earth 
> R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of earth D: concentration 
> Control a small amount of earth within 50'. At one [die]: (a) excavate a bucket's worth of dirt, (b) smooth and fill the same amount, (c) causing the earth to quickly swallow a small item, or quickly swallow a non-resisting person, chest, or signpost, (d) exhume something at the same rate, (e) knock over some hobo's shack with a tiny tremor. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects. 
> Control Fire 
> R: 50’ T: a torch’s worth of fire D: concentration 
> Control a small fire within 50’ At one [die]: (a) cause a fire to double in size, power, and brightness, (b) create a huge amount of smoke, (c) extinguish a fire no larger than a torch, (d) have a small ember (0 damage) jump 1' off the fire, (e) ignite something that is meant to be burnt, such as a match, cigarette, or fuse, (f) heat up a cup of tea to a pleasant temperature. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects. 
> Control Rain 
> R: 1000’ T: self D: [dice] hours 
> If it's raining, you can make it not rain for 1000' around you. If there's not a cloud in the sky, this spell has no effect. If it's cloudy, you can make it rain for 1000' around you. Most days have a 40% chance of being cloudy. Cannot be cast indoors. 
> Control Water 
> R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of water D: concentration 
> Control a small amount of water within 50’. At one [die]: (a) propel a small boat, (b) carry a small item through the water, (c) allow someone to swim at 2x speed, (d) force someone to swim at half speed, (e) splash something no more than 5' away, (f) dry something that is wet, (g) freeze a small amount of water, (h) cool a hot cup of tea. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects.



> 1. Dissolve 
>    R: 50' T: object or creature D: concentration 
>      Target you stare at takes 1d4 acid damage per round and begins to dissolve. Save vs Con for half damage. Can bore holes in walls, but it only makes a hole 1' and creates a lot of acidic sludge on the floor. [dice]”/10 minutes through stone, [dice]”/minute through wood, cannot affect metal. Heals slimes and oozes for 1d4/round.



> 1. [Element] Breath 
>    R: [dice]x20‘ cone T: area D: 0
>      Does 1d4 damage to anything in the cone. Save vs Con for half damage. Wind or Water breath extinguishes all fires smaller than a big bonfire. Fire breath sets very flammable things on fire. Acid breath bleaches the colour from objects and irritates the eyes.



> 1. Stoneskin 
>    R: touch T: creature D: 10 min 
>      Reduce all physical damage the target takes by [dice]x2. The target cannot swim, jump, or run.



> 1. Anklecrusher 
>    R: 50' T: [dice]x2 objects or creatures D: 0 
>      Target creature or object is grabbed by the ground itself. Target takes 1d6 damage and is immobilized. Save vs Dex to negate, prone creatures automatically fail. Target is immobilized until it can win an opposed Strength test against the ground. The effective Strength of the ground depends on what it is made out of: Dirt 8, Clay 12, Limestone 16, Basalt 18. This spell has no effect on things that aren't touching the ground.

An Elementalist will start with 2 of the 6 spells listed above (generated randomly.)

> 1. Protection from [Element] 
>    R: touch T: [dice]x[dice] targets D: 10 minutes / 8 hours 
>      Reduce all damage of the chosen type by 4 for the next 10 minutes. Alternatively, the spell protects its targets from the negative effects of the element (desert heat, arctic chill) for the next 8 hours.

The effect is caused by summoning little counter-elementals. For example, if you wanted to protect against cold damage, the Elementalist would summon a swarm of tiny fire elementals to warm the hair and skin of their allies.

> 1. Ignite 
>    R: 50' T: object or creature D: 0 
>      Target object or object takes [sum] damage and catches on fire. Save negates.



> 1. Breathe [Element] 
>    R: touch T: [dice] creatures D: 2 hr 
>      Target can breath in the chosen element, in addition to their normal modes of respiration. Clearing your lungs before the spell expires is mandatory. Does not grant you protection from that element, just from drowning in it.

 

> 1. Wind Scythe
>
> R: 50' T: object or creature D: 0
>
> Apply a melee attack from a slashing weapon in your hand to a target within 50’. If you are unarmed, counts as a dagger (1d6.) Gain +2 to Attack and deal +[sum] damage.



> 1. Wall of [Element].
>       I'm not sure what a "Wall of Acid" or "Wall of Ice" would look like, precisely, but I'm pretty sure that I could use 3 walls listed below to figure them out in a hurry.

> Wall of Earth
>
> R: 20’ T: wall D: permanent
>
> You rearrange dirt to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The wall has Defense 2 and [dice]x2 HD. If it is horizontal, the wall must be anchored on at least 2 sides.
>
> Wall of Fire
>
> R: 20’ T: wall D: 1 minute
>
> You summon fire to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The wall does not block line of sight. It deals 1d6 fire damage to anything that passes through it. Save vs Dex or be set on fire.
>
> Wall of Wind
>
> R: 20’ T: wall D: 1 minute
>
> You summon wind to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The wall does not block line of sight. Powerful winds will knock small projectiles out of the air and prevent vermin (anything smaller than a rat) from crossing. Ranged attacks that pass through the wall get [dice]x-3 to hit.



> 1. Shocking Grasp 
>       R: 0 T: self D: 10 min 
>     You enchant your hand so that it discharges [sum]+[dice]x2 damage worth of lightning into the next thing you touch. Touching an unwilling opponent requires an Attack roll against their unarmored Defense. You cannot wear any metal on the hand you enchant. If you deal more than 12 damage, you and your target must both Save or be flung apart, knocked prone, and deafened for 1d6 rounds.
