**Empowered Weapon**

Medium weapon +1 ATK that dominates the wielder. Dominated creatures use their ability scores but save, attack bonus, etc is derived from the weapon. Dominated creatures have -2 to DEX and STR for the first 3 days.  Your hold on the creature ends when it is not touching you.  If a target makes their save against you, you cannot try again until tomorrow.

You can see and hear out of the blade, but you cannot speak except through the wielder.

**Chariot**

A person who willingly joins with you becomes your "chariot".  Coercion does not work. Make a deal.

- Your chariot reduces all fire damage taken by the HD of the highest HD religious "good" character (angel, paladin, or cleric) you've ever killed. 
- At any time, you can choose to deal 1d6 to your chariot in order to deal an additional +1d6 on a hit.



**Harvest Soul**

You can drain the soul from a recently killed enemy.  This takes a standard action and requires you to impale the corpse with your demon blade within 1 round of the corpse's death.

Your wielder heals 1d6 HP, plus 1 HP for every HD of the target.

The target's soul is trapped in the demon blade.  The demon blade can hold up to 3 souls.  Trapped souls can see and hear from inside the demon blade.

You can speak with souls trapped in the demon blade (and it may be difficult to get them to shut up.) They are generally unhelpful but can become helpful if you do favors for them, fight against a mutual enemy, or entertain them.

**Spellcasting**

Beginning at level 3, you learn a new spell every level (your choice from the list), and a random spell every time you kill a dungeon boss. 

Spells are powered by souls trapped in the demon blade.  You must have sufficient trapped souls to cast a spell.  The 'X' in the spell description, refers to the HD of the trapped soul.  You use a soul in its entirety--no half-spent souls.

**Minions**

A bunch of demons show up to pledge their loyalty to you.  3d20 lemures, 1d4 bone devils, and 1d4 succubi.  They will expect you to lead a crusade back into hell, to reconquer it from the paladins.

5. Disguise
   R: 0  T: self  D: X hr
   You appear as someone else of comparable size.  This is only an illusion, but it also changes your voice to match.  (If you are playing with *detect evil*, I suppose it can fool that, too.)
