# Animist Wizard

Also known as witches. These are the *bad *wizards, the ones who live in shacks on the edge of town or castles on the edge of reality. They are the cursed ones, robed in black, who you seek when all other hopes fail. When the Church turns its back on you, when you scream curses into the night, when your very soul burns, then you are in need of an Animist Wizard... or ready to become one.

> **Perk:** If someone makes a bargain with you and breaks it, Save. If you pass, you instantly know about it. Your spells can target parasites and unborn children without targeting their hosts.

These two perks are strong contenders for the best ones around. What counts as a "parasite" is up to the GM.

> **Drawback**: You are feared and distrusted by most. You cannot bathe. You can never return another person's love.

A good GM will play up the fear and impurity an Animist Wizard carries with them. People make the sign against the evil eye when you pass. Shops close. You will never find true love unless you renounce your class and powers, although you might find corrupted substitutes.

## Cantrips:

The first cantrip is the [strangest ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vgSMFLt_No)and most emblematic. You become a creature of corruption, of black ooze and terrible swiftness. The second cantrip is for parlour tricks and ambushes. The third gives you  direct sense of corruption and impurity. You might not want to know.

## Spell List:

1. Powerful Presence
   **R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [dice] hours
     The caster seems to grow in magnificence and poise, and gains +2x[dice] bonus to Save vs Domination, Charm, or Fear effects. Easily frightened creatures (horses, mice, guilt-ridden murderers) must test Morale or flee before the caster.

A very minor fear-like effect combined with a long-duration buff. This is stage magic. You grow 2" taller and are much more sinister.

1. Telekinetic Shove
   **R**: 50‘ **T**: creature or object **D**: 0 
     An object or creature within range is hurled through the air. Save to negate. A human-sized creature travels 10’ per [dice], and takes 1d6 damage for every 10' traveled. A creature thrown at another creature requires an Attack roll to hit and inflicts 1d6 damage for every 10' traveled. This spell will also blow open all the closed but unlocked doors in a room, shatter all the windows in a building, or knock the thatched roof off a peasant's shack.

No one riding a horse or crossing a bridge would underestimate this spell. 

> 1. Shrivel
>    R. 50' **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: 1d6 rounds / permanent
>      Target Save negates. Target loses half of its current HP and loses 6 Strength (affecting the damage it deals.) When the spell ends, the lost HP and Strength returns. If you cast this spell with 3 or more [dice] against a single target, the lost HP does not return, and the Strength damage is permanent. The apparent age of the target increases considerably for the spell's duration.

 This spell can be used to threaten rather than kill, but it's a powerful threat. [Like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8zf3Mf8CBs), but in reverse. Obviously this needs to be cast with dramatic hand gestures.

> 1. Control Water 
>    **R**: 50’ **T**: a bucket’s worth of water **D**: concentration 
>      Control a small amount of water within 50’. At one [die]: (a) propel a small boat, (b) carry a small item through the water, (c) allow someone to swim at 2x speed, (d) force someone to swim at half speed, (e) splash something no more than 5' away, (f) dry something that is wet, (g) freeze a small amount of water, (h) cool a hot cup of tea. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects.

Good luck adjudicating this one, but you get the idea. With 4 [dice] you should be able to sink a ship or turn back a river. Something equivalent to a full-blast fireball. Water elementals carry means of purifying corruption, and Animists know their secret ways.

> 1. Sleep 
>    **R**: 50' **T**: [sum] HD of creatures **D**: 10 min / permanent 
>      Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap (a standard action.) Non-alert, unaware targets are not allowed a Save.  If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

You can't cast this spell on an apple, but you can use it to save someone from a famine, the pain of death, or other horrible fates. You can also use it to put goblins to sleep. It's a classic.

> 1. Charm Person
>    **R**: 50' **T**: person **D**: [dice] hours 
>      The person regards you as a good friend and ignores the obvious spell you just cast on them. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.

So not dragons, dryads, owlbears, ants, elementals, or angels. People. If it's worried about taxes, gossips, and wears pants, it's a person. This effect overrides the drawback of being an Animist Wizard, but not for long.

> 1. Dream Eater
>    **R**: 50‘ **T**: creature **D**: 0 
>      A sleeping creature within 50' takes [sum] damage. The caster heals for the same amount. No save. When you gain this spell, if you don't know Sleep already, you learn it the next time you would roll to gain a spell. It replaces one of the spells you'd roll for.

A nasty, petty sort of spell that provides some rare healing in this system. You're eating a poor creature's soul, or at least, the interesting parts of it. This spell doesn't work on creatures that don't dream (snails, worms, bureaucrats.) 

> 1. Scorching Ray
>    **R**: 100' **T**: creatures or objects **D**: 0 
>      Fire a ray at a target, dealing 1d10 fire damage with a successful attack roll. Each dice you invest in this spell allow you to fire an additional ray at the same target or at a new target. Creatures are not set on fire, but very flammable objects such as candles, dry straw, or paper will catch fire 1 round after being struck. Instead of using this spell to deal damage, you can instead use it to light all the candles in a single room.

The fire conjured by an animist wizard is a dark and greasy sort, an outcast elemental. 

> 1. Scry 
>    **R**: [dice]x100' **T**: point in space **D**: concentration 
>      You conjure an invisible, intangible, floating eyeball to a point in space that you designate. Unlike most spells, you do not have to have line of sight to cast it. As long as you maintain concentration, you can see through this sensor with your normal senses. This spell requires something to scry on, usually a mirror, quiet pool, clouds, or bonfire. If you invest 2 or more [dice], you can also hear through the sensor (it grows an ear.) If you invest at 3 or more [dice], you can also speak through the sensor (it grows a dribbly little mouth.) If you use an actual crystal ball when casting this spell, the range is instead [dice] miles. Crystal balls are rare enough that they are never offered for sale, but are worth upwards of 3,000gp. Most are ancestral relics.

I like the idea of a horrible dribbly little homonculus flying around and spying on people.  

> 10.Alter Self
> **R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [dice]x10 minutes 
> Alter your form to resemble that of another creature of your type (usually humanoid.) You do not gain any special abilities from this transformation.

You can't alter your smell, and you can't hide from Wizard Vision or an angry mob forever.

**Emblem Spells**

> 1. Doom
>       **R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: concentration 
>       Target feels cold. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, and you loudly pronounce doom on them for the next 2 turns (without being interrupted or breaking line of sight), target dies on the 3rd turn. You need to truly hate the target for this spell to work, or convince yourself that you hate the target. Even a sliver of pity cancels the spell.

You can kill anything with this spell. You might need to test Wisdom or Charisma to prove you really hate a target

> 1. Curse
>       **R**: 50' **T**: mortal creature **D**: permanent
>       You inflict a Minor or Major curse on the target. For a minor curse, you must invest 2 [dice]. For a major curse, you must invest 4 [dice]. Dice used to cast this spell are automatically exhausted. You cannot dispel your own curses.

The tables at the end of the post list some example curses.

> **Mishaps **
>
> 1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
> 2. Take 1d6 damage 
> 3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a save. Permanent if you fail. Resembles your transformation. 
> 4. Blind for 1d6 rounds 
> 5. Deafened for 1d6 rounds 
> 6. Spell targets you (if harmful) or enemy (if beneficial) or fizzles (if neutral.)

The Mishap table isn't too severe, but the last result is unique to Animist Wizards and represents your spell rejecting you and your goals. Nice work. 

> **Doom of the Animist **
>
> 1. Some aspect of your transformation manifests for 1 day. 
> 2. Some aspect of your transformation becomes permanent. You become crueler and greedier. 
> 3. Your transformation becomes permanent. You become bestial and monstrous. You become a dangerous NPC. 

This doom can be avoided by true love, or by slaying the last of a powerful species (black dragons, elder trees, creation elementals, abandoned gods.) 
Your transformation grows to corrupt you, or your corruption grows to transform you. Difficult to say. Eventually, you're going to turn on your friends and devour them. True love requires you to love someone back, and that means giving up your powers forever.

## Curses

I stole some of these curses from [here](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2015/01/d20-curses.html), and others from... other sites. I can't remember where. Anyway, they are only examples. Roll randomly, pick a curse, or inflict something thematic.
Cursed people need to have their curse identified (by a priest, a hermit, a madman, a fairy, etc..) Identification also reveals the way to remove the curse. You can also try all sorts of risky exorcisms and rituals to get rid of the curse instead. Some of the effects seem severe, but remember, they could be "just die" instead. Curses should be appropriate to the target, their sins, and the caster's whims.
