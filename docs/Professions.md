**Guild Professions** (marked with a G) require membership in a guild.

**High-Status Professions** (82-100) earn double Income. You are also treated better, even as an apprentice, than most other professions.

Normally, a player character starts with a Profession as a Skill and with the item listed, but not with the weapon listed.
