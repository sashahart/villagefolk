### Travel

See *Overland Travel* or *Overland Travel, Traditional*.

### Forage

A party may forage when in a wilderness environment. (Doing this requires every party member's turn.) It does not take extra time or slow travel, but it may only be done once per 6 miles per day. Roll under half the Wisdom of one party member to  gain the party enough food for d6 meals (a meal is only half of a ration.)

### Hunt

A party may hunt when in a wilderness environment. It requires one hour and causes two encounter checks. Roll under half of a party member's Wisdom and spend 2 arrows.

A character may attempt to roll under half of their wisdom in order to Hunt, Forage, or find Herbs. Hunting costs 1d4 arrows and gives 1d4 rations. Foraging gives 1d3 rations. Herbalism gives a single beneficial herb which can act as medicine.

### Explore

| **Choose one of the below:** | Obvious   | Not Obvious | Hidden           | Well-hidden |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **D6 result**                | [No Roll] | 1-3         | 1-2              | 1           |
| **MOVE Check**               | [No Roll] | MOVE+WIS-2  | Check MOVE+WIS-5 | MOVE+WiS-9  |

Obvious features are discovered upon moving into a hex.

To explore the hex the characters are in, spend the same number of hours it would cost to move into the current hex (consult the Overland Travel Chart.) Then roll 1d6 to determine if unnoticed features of interest are discovered. (Give a bonus to this roll equal to the Wisdom modifier of a party member who has knowledge of this kind of terrain.)
