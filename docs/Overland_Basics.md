## Daylight

Traveling at night is nearly impossible without a road. (You might choose to make an exception for a full moon.) 

When night travel occurs, increase the probability of a random encounter by one die face at night. (This usually means a 2 in 6 chance of an encounter.)

Winter - 8 hours of light
Spring/Fall - 11 hours of light
Summer - 14 hours of light

## Encounter Checks In the Wilderness

Encounters are checked once when the party is sleeping, once per hex moved through (or once per 6 miles), and whenever the party is loud.

The chance of encounters depends on the terrain being explored. By default, use the following probabilities, with higher rolls resulting in encounters:
City, clear, grasslands, settled lands: 1-in-6.
Barren, desert, forest, hills, ocean, river: 2-in-6.
Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6.

## Hex Travel

The standard hex size is 6x6 miles wide.

For the sake of simplicity, assume the party is at the center of the hex they begin in and that their destination is at the center of the hex they stop traveling in.

However, the referee (or a published adventure) may choose other measurements.

------

When moving from one 6-mile hex into another one, the total distance travelled is 6 miles. 

When moving all the way across one hex and ending in a new hex adjacent to it, the distance travelled is 9 miles.

## Overland Sight

Characters can usually see for three miles around them, in open terrain. 

This range may sometimes be reduced (e.g. in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or increased (e.g. looking out from the top of a mountain.)
