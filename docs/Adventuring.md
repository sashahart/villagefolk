# Checks - The Core Mechanic

## Check

> **Stat Check**: roll a D20 equal to target value or under target value.

Sometimes, the referee might ask a player character to make a check against a stat. For example, MOVE might be checked to attempt to jump over a pit or STR might be checked to attempt to push a heavy or stuck object.

To check a stat, a player rolls 1D20 and, if the result is less than or equal to the stat (this is the "Target Number"), the check succeeds. If the roll is greater than the ability, the check fails.

An unmodified (natural) roll of 1 is always a success and a natural 20 is always a failure, regardless of penalties and bonuses.

---

Example: A player character checks their MOVE stat to jump over a pit. The player character has a move score of 12 but the pit is dangerously wide, so the Referee imposes a +2 penalty. The player rolls a 12. This would normally be a success, but the penalty means that the result is a 14. The player character falls into the pit.


## Penalties and bonuses

Whenever a player makes a check, bonuses or penalties may be applied to the target number, with a modifier of +3 resulting in a much easier check and a -3 resulting in a much more difficult check. Just use -3, -2, -1, +1, +2, and +3. Other numbers are for very unusual circumstances.

---

Miranda has a character named Sammi. Sammi's target foe is not visible (perhaps a human hiding in an unlit room.) The referee assigns a -10 penalty to Sammi's ATK. This means that, even though Sammi's sheet says that her ATK is 11, in the dark, her ATK is only 1. This means the player would need to roll a 1 to succeed at hitting the enemy.

However, imagine this: Miranda says "Sammi is going to wait to swing her sword until she hears something standing near her, paying attention to the direction of the sound. She will swing the sword wide, in a circle." The Referee might now change the penalty to just -2 if the foe is not taking care to be quiet, but if she misses, she'll hit someone else in her party, if they don't hurry to get out of the way.

Add a Cover example. 

A PC hiding behind a door might get a +3 to defensive rolls. A PC hiding behind a 4' tall rock might only get +2.

### Bonus and Penalty guide

| +10            | +8   | +6   | +4        | +2   | -2        | -4             | -6   | -8   | -10                 |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ---- | --------- | -------------- | ---- | ---- | ------------------- |
| Extremely easy |      |      | Very Easy | Easy | Difficult | Very difficult |      |      | Extremely Difficult |

---

## Opposed Stat Check

> **Opposed Check: ATR + [10-Opposing ATR]**

An opposed check is a check that has a penalty (or bonus) based on an opposing force. The target number to roll under is the sum of the player character's relevant attribute score and 10 minus the opposing attribute.

---

To quickly simulate a game of chess against a very wily wizard, an opposed intelligence check might look like this:

Player Character intelligence: 10. 
Wizard intelligence (as defined by the referee at the moment the check is made): 18.

ATR + [10-Opposing ATR] = opposed check
10 + [10-18] = opposed check
10 + [-8] = 2 = opposed check

In this case, the player must roll a 1 or 2 to succeed at the opposed check and win the game of chess.

If the player character has a "Games" Tag or if the player character finds a way to distract the wizard, a bonus to the check would be gained.

If the wizard is being pleaded with by an urchin claiming to be his son, the referee might decide to award a bonus of 2 to the check. Now the player character only needs to roll 4 or under to succeed. 



# Procedure of Play

## Overland Turn

Overland turns are used when traveling over a distance.

1. The referee does maintenance (checks for light sources and other things altered by time.)
2. The party decides where to travel.
3. The referee determines whether the party becomes lost and determines weather, if deemed necessary.
4. The referee checks for wandering monsters or other encounters. 
5. The referee describes terrain and locations as players move through, allowing players to react and describing the results. If an encounter with a possibly hostile creature or person occurs, follow the encounter Procedure.

------

When checking for encounters, you may use a system presented to you in the module you're using, or you may use this simple system:

**Random Travel Encounters (d6)**

| 1       | 2            | 3          | 4       | 5-6     |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Monster | Monster Omen | Non-combat | Mundane | Nothing |

or

- Hunting.  Slows the party down a lot and costs some ammunition, but might yield a lot food.
- Foraging.  Slows the party down a little, but might yield modest amounts of food.
- Befriending NPCs.  Can raise their morale.  If you talk to an NPC all day and make a successful Charisma check, roll a d12.  If the result is higher than the NPC's current morale, it improves by 1.  Requires a tiny bit of roleplaying.
- Herbalizing.  Slows the party down a little, but might yield valuable medicines and antidotes.
- Just chatting with each other.  Awards a tiny amount of XP, like 10xp per day traveled in dangerous wilderness.  Requires a tiny bit of roleplaying.
- Scouting.  Slows the party down a litte, but gives them a chance to find a defensible/hidden place to spend the night.  Also gives a higher chance of finding hidden locations in the hex.

## Exploration Turn

Exploration turns are used in dungeons, cities, buildings, and so forth.

1. The referee does maintenance (check for wandering monsters or other encounters, light sources, and other things altered by time.)
2. Each PC describes their actions for one turn. (Each turn represents approximately ten minutes.)
3. The referee describes the results. If an encounter with creatures or persons of unknown disposition occurs, follow the encounter Procedure.
4. If the players decide to camp, roll
   1. Conflict
   2. Amity
   3. Domestic Bliss
   4. Snag
   5. Prowess
   6. Poor Health 

## Haven Turn

http://www.paperspencils.com/2017/06/11/the-haven-turn/
1 month **Haven Turns** may be spent on one downtime action per player. May only be taken to celebrate a safe return from an adventure. A lot of things should probably happen in the world during this time.

## Encounters

See *Combat*

# Adventuring Rules

## Climbing

> Check **MOVE** to **climb**. 
>
> Add **1 ATR modifier per turn spent studying** the route. If a new segment is visible, do a second MOVE check.

Each exploration turn spent studying the climbing route will add one Attribute modifier from the player character's sheet to their MOVE.

Roll under the character's (adjusted) MOVE. 

If the roll fails, the referee should roll a D10 to see what percent is climbed before the fall.

---

A character with a MOVE of 12 and a Wisdom modifier of +2 could spend one turn to study the route. When they add their Wisdom modifier, the player will attempt to roll under 14 instead of under 12 to successfully complete the climb. 

## Conditions

> **Fatigue, Soaked, and Cold** each use 2 slots. Check CON to avoid gaining fatigue. 

**Fatigue** is gained as a result of exhausting activity. Traveling more than 12 hours adds 1 fatigue per hour.

A player character may check Constitution to resist gaining fatigue. 

**Soaked** is caused by clothing and backpack being wet.

**Cold** is caused by exposure to very cold temperature.

## Currency


Only one coin is in popular usage. It's made of copper. 100 of them use one slot. 1000 of them fit in a coin purse, which uses one slot.

## Distance

A hex is typically 6x6 miles. Squares on a dungeon map are typically 10x10 feet. 

A square is usually 10'x10'. 

However, the referee (or a published adventure) may choose other measurements.

## Doors

> Heavy doors = 1 Exploration turn to open. Likely to shut.

Typically, doors in a dungeon are heavy.

Heavy doors require 1 exploration turn to open and are likely to swing shut if not wedged open. 

### Stuck Doors

Doors have a 2 in 6 chance of being stuck. A stuck door will only open on a successful STR check.

---

### Wedging Doors

Doors may be held open or closed using iron spikes or other wedges. 

---

Wedging doors open can allow for a much quicker escape. Instead of spending one turn (about ten minutes) per door, characters can just walk through an open passage.

Wedging doors shut can create a safe space to sleep in when exploring a dungeon. It can keep monsters from wandering through the room the player characters are in while they loudly dig a tunnel through a wall.

## Drunkenness

Typically, every alcoholic drink beyond the first adds one point of drunkenness, but this will depend on the Constitution of the character and on the alcoholic content of the drink.

Each point of drunkenness expands the critical failure range by 1 until morning.

---

Joe has a fairly standard Constitution. He drank 3 beers, so his critical failure range has expanded by 2 points to 18-20. If he rolls an 18 during a check, he'll critically fail the check.

## Falling

> **1D6 damage per 10' fallen beyond first 10'**. 
> **Hanging** from a ledge **reduces** distance by **10**'. 
> **Intentional** falls result in a **DEX check** to **reduce** the calculated distance by **10'**.
> **50% chance of fragile items breaking**.

Every 10 feet fallen beyond the first 10 feet incurs 1d6 damage to the character. Hanging from a ledge reduces the calculated fall distance by 10 feet. Intentionally falling causes a Dexterity check; success reduces the calculated fall distance by 10 feet.

When the calculated fall distance is greater than 10 feet, there is a 50% chance of fragile items breaking, unless they are held in hand. Roll a D6 for each stored, fragile item. On a result of 1-3, the item will break.

## Foraging

A party may forage when in a wilderness environment. (Doing this requires every party member's turn.) It does not take extra time or slow travel, but it may only be done once per 6 miles per day. Roll under half the Wisdom of one party member to  gain the party enough food for d6 meals (a meal is only half of a ration.) 

---

## Hit Dice

A Hit Die (HD) is a d8 unless otherwise specified.

Hit Dice can be used to determine the hit points of a non-player character or a monster. (See below.) 

They can also be used to grant an ATK bonus to non-player character or monster. The number of HD a monster or non-player character may usually be considered equal to their level.

### Hit Points from Hit Dice

To determine Hit Points of a non-player character or monster, do whichever the following you prefer:

1. Check the monster's stats to see if they have a specific number of hit points. If they do, this is the best method.
2. Multiply the number of hit dice by 4 (or by 5 to create stronger enemies.) This is fast, simple, and consistent.
3. Roll all of the hit dice and use the total. This is the most traditional method. It's very random, which is less consistent and less predictable for players and referee.

### Bonus ATK from Hit Dice

A non-player character or monster gets a bonus to ATK equal to their number of Hit Dice (unless they are assigned a specific bonus in their stat block or description.) 

A monster with 3 HD would have a bonus of +3.

### Ability Scores derived from Hit Dice

A non-player character or monster has a default ability score equal to 10 + HD when an ability score is needed for an opposed check.

A monster with 3 HD usually has 13 Strength, 13 Dexterity, 13 Intelligence, etc.

Modify their ability scores as needed, when appropriate. A gigantic, rampaging hippo with 2 HD probably doesn't have an intelligence as high as 12, for example. 

## Hit Points

> Each point *below* 0 HP for a PC = Lethal  = Death and Dismemberment Table

Hit points represent the ability to not be hit. At 0 a character has been physically harmed and must roll on the death and dismemberment table.

A Player Character's maximum Hit Points are derived from Constitution as shown on the Level Chart.

## Holding Breath

A character can hold their breath for combat rounds equal to CON÷2.

If the character is physically prepared, they may hold their breath for combat rounds equal to CON.

## Hunting

A party may hunt when in a wilderness environment. It requires one hour and causes two encounter checks. Roll under half of a party member's Wisdom and spend 2 arrows.

A character may attempt to roll under half of their wisdom in order to Hunt, Forage, or find Herbs. Hunting costs 1d4 arrows and gives 1d4 rations. Foraging gives 1d3 rations. Herbalism gives a single beneficial herb which can act as medicine.

## Light, Vision, Visibility

**Light: Sources **last a length of time **OR** use *Light Checks* (below.)

**Torch**: 20’ bright light, 40' shadows. Burns for 1 hour. 5 per one slot.

**Lantern**: 30’ bright light, 60’ shadows. Burns for 3 hours per bottle of lampoil.

**Candle**: 5’ bright light, 15’ shadows. Burns for 1 hour. 10 per 1 slot.

**Flint and tinder to light**. 1D4 – DEX modifier rounds light.Minimum = 1 round.

### Light Checks

Torch: D8	Candle: D10 			Lantern: D20

Each turn, roll. If the result is less than four, use a lower die. 

If anything less than a four is rolled on a D4, the light source is depleted. 

Use these steps: D20 -> D12 ->D10 -> D8 -> D6 -> D4 -> depleted.

### Overland Sight

Characters can usually see for three miles around them, in open terrain. 

This range may sometimes be reduced (e.g. in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or increased (e.g. looking out from the top of a mountain.)

## Saving Throws

### Rolling a Saving Throw

> **SAVE: **Check [relevant stat]-5. If no stat is relevant, use SAVE stat.

> **Save** = 5 + Charisma Modifier + Level.

A successful saving throw decreases or cancels a negative effect.

---

## Tags

> +1 to checks. Improved tag = +2. Gained and improved in haven turns.

Tags grant +1 to related checks until they improve.

A player character will permanently gain a Tag if he or she successfully practices or studies it for one haven turn. 

A player character will permanently improve a Tag if he or she practices or studies it for one haven turn. An improved Tag grants +2 to related rolls.

---


## Sleep Deprivation

> Less than 8 hours sleep in a day = -1 to all rolls. Cumulative -1 each day.

---

## Starvation

For every 24 hours without food, save against Constitution to prevent one Constitution point being lost.

Without water, save against Constitution to prevent Constitution being halved.

After the third time, die.

> Recover Constitution lost in this way at double the usual ATR recovery rate with rest and food.

---


## Stealth

> **STEALTH** = 5 + DEX MOD - ENC. Use STEALTH of least stealthy character.
> Roll under STEALTH to move quietly.
> Roll under STEALTH-Opposing WIS to hide or pickpocket. 

---

## Swimming

> **Swim** = MOVE÷3’ per turn. Not possible in armor heavier than leather.

---

## Time

> 1 Haven turn = 4 weeks. 
> 1 Standard turn = about 10 minutes.
> 1 Combat Round = about 6 seconds. 

6 Seconds = 1 Combat Round
10 Combat Rounds = 1 Minute
10 Minutes = 1 Local Turn
6 Local Turns = 1 Hour
24 Hours = 1 Day
7 Days = 1 Week
5 Weeks = 1 Month (35 Days)
10 Months = 1 Year (350 days) 



---

## Treasure

PCs can evaluate raw metals and they count directly as CP, SP, or GP.

Thieves and other similarly - minded experts can INT check to evaluate other standard-valued items (like gems.)

---

## Traps

Traps may give an x-in-6 chance to go off if the referee wishes. 2-in-6 means they've deteriorated or are poorly designed. 5-in-6 means they are designed well and are in good condition. Lower numbers on a D6 are safe results.

---

Traps should be described so that attentive players can examine and attempt to disarm them. 


## Wandering Monsters

### In Dungeons

The probability of encountering an enemy in a dungeon or other similar locale is usually specific to that locale. If it is not assigned, adventurers encounter monsters when rolling a 6 on a D6.

---


### In the Wilderness

Encounters are checked once when the party is sleeping, once per hex moved through (or once per 6 miles), and whenever the party is loud.

The chance of encounters depends on the terrain being explored. By default, use the following probabilities, with higher rolls resulting in encounters:
City, clear, grasslands, settled lands: 1-in-6.
Barren, desert, forest, hills, ocean, river: 2-in-6.
Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6.

---

# Solo Player Character

A solo player character may decide at the beginning of each session (or day) to pay 50% of their experience to gain the following benefits:

Always gain initiative except when the enemy has surprise.

May spend 1 turn to **bind wounds** *immediately* after combat. Roll a d4. 1-2 heals 1 HP. 2-4 heals 2 HP.

---


# Game License



# Notes

## Troika card inventory

Items are written on blank business cards or index cards. 3 are readied (in hand or belt.) Stack the ones you are not using. This stack is your backpack.

To get an item from the backpack while in combat, roll a d20 and subtract 2 from your roll (minimum result of 1.)You can take any item at or below the result.

Advantages:  Inventory tangibility, quick backpack sorting, and easy passing of items (with notes written on them.)

## Exploding damage die

All damage die explode. (when their highest value is reached, a second damage die with the same number of sides will be rolled and added to the result.)

## Alternate crits

Count all 20 and higher sums as critical failures instead of just a natural 20. Count all 1 and lower as critical hits.

## Curse Rules

## Mutations and morphs

## Death and Dismemberment (Goblin Punch Version 26)

When you take damage in excess of your HP, you roll on the Death Table. Roll d20 + excess damage and look up the result on the table.

 Natural 1 = Regain 1d6 HP. Gain a cool scar.

 5 or less = Prone and Disarmed.

 6-15 = Knocked Out. Beaten for 1 day.

 16-25 = Dying. Beaten for 1 day. Gain an ugly scar.

 26+ = Dead 

**Magical Healing**

Magical Healing always restores your HP from the regular floor of 0 HP, eliminating any Knocked Out or Dying conditions. (A character healed for 3 HP will be left at HP 3.) You remain Beaten, however.

### Scars

 No effect beyond the cosmetic. Write them down on the back of your character sheet.

### Beaten

 -2 to Attack rolls.

•             20% spell failure chance.

•             When you roll on the Death Table, add +10 to your result.

###       Knocked Out

 At the end of each combat round, make a DC 11 Con check.

–          If you succeed, you wake up. (You are still Prone and Disarmed.)

–          If you roll a natural 1, you lose a point from a random stat. 

•             If anyone spends a standard action tending to you, you wake up.

### Dying

 At the end of each combat round, roll a d20.

–          Natural 1: you lose two points from a random stat.

–          2-9: you lose a point from a random stat.

–          Natural 20: your condition improves to Knocked Out.

–          If you've lost more than two stat points from this injury, you die.

•             Anyone can attempt to stabilize you with a -7 Int check. Once you are stabilized, your condition improves to Knocked Out.

•             Getting dropped to dying is probably going to be at least 3 turns of downtime: one round spent getting out of Dying, one round getting out of Knocked Out, and one round standing up and recovering your dropped sword.
