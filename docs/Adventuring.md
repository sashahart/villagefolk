# Adventuring Rules

## Doors

> Heavy doors = 1 Exploration turn to open. Likely to shut.

Typically, doors in a dungeon are heavy.

Heavy doors require 1 exploration turn to open and are likely to swing shut if not wedged open. 

### Stuck Doors

Doors have a 2 in 6 chance of being stuck. A stuck door will only open on a successful STR check.

---

### Wedging Doors

Doors may be held open or closed using iron spikes or other wedges. 

---

Wedging doors open can allow for a much quicker escape. Instead of spending one turn (about ten minutes) per door, characters can just walk through an open passage.

Wedging doors shut can create a safe space to sleep in when exploring a dungeon. It can keep monsters from wandering through the room the player characters are in while they loudly dig a tunnel through a wall.

## Drunkenness

Typically, every alcoholic drink beyond the first adds one point of drunkenness, but this will depend on the Constitution of the character and on the alcoholic content of the drink.

Each point of drunkenness expands the critical failure range by 1 until morning.

---

Joe has a fairly standard Constitution. He drank 3 beers, so his critical failure range has expanded by 2 points to 18-20. If he rolls an 18 during a check, he'll critically fail the check.

---

## Hit Dice

A Hit Die (HD) is a d8 unless otherwise specified.

Hit Dice can be used to determine the hit points of a non-player character or a monster. (See below.) 

They can also be used to grant an ATK bonus to non-player character or monster. The number of HD a monster or non-player character may usually be considered equal to their level.

### Hit Points from Hit Dice

To determine Hit Points of a non-player character or monster, do whichever the following you prefer:

1. Check the monster's stats to see if they have a specific number of hit points. If they do, this is the best method.
2. Multiply the number of hit dice by 4 (or by 5 to create stronger enemies.) This is fast, simple, and consistent.
3. Roll all of the hit dice and use the total. This is the most traditional method. It's very random, which is less consistent and less predictable for players and referee.

### Bonus ATK from Hit Dice

A non-player character or monster gets a bonus to ATK equal to their number of Hit Dice (unless they are assigned a specific bonus in their stat block or description.) 

A monster with 3 HD would have a bonus of +3.

### Ability Scores derived from Hit Dice

A non-player character or monster has a default ability score equal to 10 + HD when an ability score is needed for an opposed check.

A monster with 3 HD usually has 13 Strength, 13 Dexterity, 13 Intelligence, etc.

Modify their ability scores as needed, when appropriate. A gigantic, rampaging hippo with 2 HD probably doesn't have an intelligence as high as 12, for example. 

## Holding Breath

A character can hold their breath for combat rounds equal to CON÷2.

If the character is physically prepared, they may hold their breath for combat rounds equal to CON.

---


## Sleep Deprivation

> Less than 8 hours sleep in a day = -1 to all rolls. Cumulative -1 each day.

---

## Starvation

For every 24 hours without food, save against Constitution to prevent one Constitution point being lost.

Without water, save against Constitution to prevent Constitution being halved.

After the third time, die.

> Recover Constitution lost in this way at double the usual ATR recovery rate with rest and food.

---

## Time

> 1 Haven turn = 4 weeks. 
> 1 Standard turn = about 10 minutes.
> 1 Combat Round = about 6 seconds. 

6 Seconds = 1 Combat Round
10 Combat Rounds = 1 Minute
10 Minutes = 1 Local Turn
6 Local Turns = 1 Hour
24 Hours = 1 Day
7 Days = 1 Week
5 Weeks = 1 Month (35 Days)
10 Months = 1 Year (350 days) 



---

## Treasure

PCs can evaluate raw metals and they count directly as CP, SP, or GP.

Thieves and other similarly - minded experts can INT check to evaluate other standard-valued items (like gems.)

---

## Traps

Traps may give an x-in-6 chance to go off if the referee wishes. 2-in-6 means they've deteriorated or are poorly designed. 5-in-6 means they are designed well and are in good condition. Lower numbers on a D6 are safe results.

---

Traps should be described so that attentive players can examine and attempt to disarm them. 


## Wandering Monsters

### In Dungeons

The probability of encountering an enemy in a dungeon or other similar locale is usually specific to that locale. If it is not assigned, adventurers encounter monsters when rolling a 6 on a D6.

---


### In the Wilderness

Encounters are checked once when the party is sleeping, once per hex moved through (or once per 6 miles), and whenever the party is loud.

The chance of encounters depends on the terrain being explored. By default, use the following probabilities, with higher rolls resulting in encounters:
City, clear, grasslands, settled lands: 1-in-6.
Barren, desert, forest, hills, ocean, river: 2-in-6.
Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6.

# Notes

## Troika card inventory

Items are written on blank business cards or index cards. 3 are readied (in hand or belt.) Stack the ones you are not using. This stack is your backpack.

To get an item from the backpack while in combat, roll a d20 and subtract 2 from your roll (minimum result of 1.)You can take any item at or below the result.

Advantages:  Inventory tangibility, quick backpack sorting, and easy passing of items (with notes written on them.)
