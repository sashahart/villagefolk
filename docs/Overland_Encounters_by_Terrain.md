# Overland Encounters, by Terrain

Encounters are checked once when the party is sleeping, once per hex moved through (or once per 6 miles), and whenever the party is loud.

The chance of encounters depends on the terrain being explored. By default, use the following probabilities, with higher rolls resulting in encounters:
City, clear, grasslands, settled lands: 1-in-6.
Barren, desert, forest, hills, ocean, river: 2-in-6.
Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6.
