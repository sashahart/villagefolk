## Encounter Procedure

1. The referee may determine if either party is surprised by the other (by circumstance or by a roll - see *Surprise*, below) and determines how far away the creatures or persons of unknown disposition are.
2. Players must roll initiative (see **Combat Procedure**.)
3. The referee determines the reaction to the party (usually with a **Reaction Check**.) The players decide how their characters will act:
4. A. If both parties wish to talk, they may.
   B. If the player party decides to flee, the referee determines whether the other party pursues (usually with a Morale Check.)
   C. If combat occurs, follow the **Combat Procedure**.

## Combat Procedure

1. Check **Morale** if enemy is outnumbered,outclassed, or reduced to half STR (in number or HP.)
2. Initiative (**WIS**) check. Success = act before enemy. Fail = act after. Act in order of rolls, lowest to highest.
3. After initiative has been determined, the party may decide to spend their turns fleeing (see **Chases**) instead of taking **Combat Actions**.
4. **6 second turn**. Take one **Combat Action**. Some minor actions (like looking at the enemy) do not take a significant amount of time and may be used in addition to a character's combat action.

### Combat Duration

A combat encounter takes at least one full turn (about ten minutes.) This includes recovery time.

### Encounter Distance

An encounter usually occurs at the maximum range the player party can see. 

Enemies might attack before this, at their range, if they can see the players, but no encounter begins because the player party does not encounter the enemy.

### Surprise

> 1D6. 1 = gain surprise. 6 = be surprised. **Surprise** = +4 ATK & act first on round 1.

If there is a chance that either party is surprised, roll 1D6. If the result does not fit the situation, ignore it.

If a 1 is rolled, the player characters surprise the opposition.
If a 6 is rolled, the opposition surprises the players. 

A party that has surprise will act 1st on round 1 without need for an initiative check and gain +4 ATK for round 1.

If one party carries a light source and the other party does not, the party without a light source may not be surprised. (Most creatures who live underground can see in the dark, however, so they may not need to carry a light source.)

### Monster or NPC reaction

When someone is encountered, the referee may request that a reaction be rolled by whichever party member is in front.

| **2d6**      | 2       | 3-5               | 6-8         | 9-11       | 12      |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Reaction** | Helpful | Somewhat Friendly | Instinctual | Aggressive | Hostile |

### Chases

> Opposed Check **MOVE**  against enemy's move to **pursue or flee**. 
>
> [Difference between result and MOVE]' = steps gained/lost.
>
> 5 steps away = evaded pursuers.
>
> If pursuers catch party, pursuers have initiative.

1. Before anything else, a pursued may drop an item. If it is something a pursuer desires, roll morale to see if the pursuer stops pursuit to take the item.
2. To flee or pursue, the slowest member of the player party does an opposed MOVE Stat check against the enemy's MOVE.
3. Find the difference between the rolled result and the MOVE score. The player party gains that many "steps"* if they succeed. The enemy gains that many "steps" if they succeed. 
4. **A.** If the pursued are 5 steps ahead, they've lost the pursuers. If the player party has successfully fled, check the enemy's morale to determine whether they search for the player party.
   **B.** If the pursuers catch up to the pursued, the chase is over and the pursuers automatically win initiative.

*A "step" is usually about 10'.

## Combat Actions

### Attack

> **Attack**: ATK score - Enemy DEF = Target Number. Result: Hit or grapple.
>
> **DEF** = 10 + worn armor.  Defend = check DEF - enemy HD.

An attack is an attempt to hit with a weapon or an attempt to grapple. If a 20 is rolled, check weapon for **Breakage**.

A fumble when defending results in an armor **Breakage** check. 

------

## Criticals

### Critical Successes

 A roll of a natural 1 in combat is a Critical Success. This grants a free combat maneuver or an additional roll of the damage die.

### Critical Failure

> Check for breakage if ATK roll or DEF roll = natural 20.

> **Fragile** weapons always break.
> **Standard** weapons = 3-in-6 chance on d6. All weapons are Standard unless specified otherwise.
> **Masterwork** weapons= 1-in-6 chance on d6. First break = -1 to ATK. Second break = useless.

> **Armor break** = -1 to DEF per break. Useless when penalty equals the bonus.

### More crits

Count all 20 and higher sums as critical failures instead of just a natural 20. Count all 1 and lower as critical hits.

### Enemy Defense

> **Enemy Defense**. If you're using enemies with a Descending Armor Class from another game, you can convert that number to enemy defense by subtracting 10.
> A descending Armor Class (AC) of 18 is the same as a defense of 8. Exception: Lamentations of the Flame Princess increases the base AC from 10 to 12. To convert AC in Lamentations of the Flame Princess to Defense, subtract 12.
>
> 

>  Ben Milton's phrasing in Knave: "Monster AC (if ascending) is identical to Armor defense. If the AC is descending, subtract it from 19 (if it has Original or B/X AC) or from 20 (if it has 1st edition or 2nd edition AC) to find its ascending equivalent. ""

> **Enemy Attack**. 8 is incompetent. 11 is standard. 15 is great.

#### Non-lethal Attacks

Non-lethal damage may be dealt if a player announces their intent before making the attack. This results in a penalty to the attack and/or damage roll (usually -1 to each.)

#### Damage Rolls

> **Light weapons** 1D6 + Str MOD DMG. Throwable (- 1 ATK for every 10' beyond the first 10'.)

> **Medium weapons** 1D6 + STR MOD DMG or 1D8 + STR MOD DMG with two hands.

> **Heavy weapons** 1D10 + STR MOD DMG, two hands. Not usable in confined spaces. 2 Slots.

> **Improvised Weapons** = -2 ATK.

> **Slings** = 1D6 DMG. -1 ATK for every 20' beyond the first 20'. Share Slot with up to 3 stones. Stones can always be gathered with a few minutes.

> **Bows** 1D6 DMG. -1 ATK for every 30' beyond the first 30'.

> **Crossbows** 1D10 DMG. -1 ATK for every 40' beyond the first 40'. Reload costs one turn.

> **Fists and feet** 1 + STR MOD DMG

------



### Combat Maneuvers

> **Combat Maneuvers**: Shove, trip,disarm, grapple, and other opposed stunts.

> 1. Check ATK - target's HD.
> 2. **Fail** = target hits player character.
> 3. **Regardless**, make opposed ATR check. **Success** = maneuver occurs.

------

### Grapple

> **Grapple: **Tie = nothing happens. Wait for next combat round.
>
> **Defender wins** = stuns attacker.
>
> **Attackers win**= defender is pinned and helpless.

------

### Retrieve Item from Backpack

> **Retrieve** from backpack = 1D3 combat rounds.

------



## Combat Special Cases

### Appropriate weaponry

You may add a bonus damage die (of the weaponâ€™s type) to the roll if you attack an enemy from hiding or use the ideal weapon against an enemy type . Multiple bonuses results in multiple extra damage dice.cked

------

Using a blunt weapon against a skeleton grants one extra damage dice. Using a silver sword dipped in holy water against a vampire grants two extra damage dice. Using a silver sword dipped in holy water against a vampire who doesn't know he is being attacked grants three extra damage dice.



### Attacking from Behind

> **Attack from behind = +2 bonus ATK. If from STEALTH, check DEX or STR. 

> Fail = x2 DMG.
> Success = 3x damage.

------

## Fire

> **On Fire**: Take 1D6 DMG per Combat Round. Extinguishing uses one Combat Round (DEX check.)

## Initiative

> **Initiative** check = **WIS** check.
> Success = act before enemy. Fail = act after.

> Act in order of rolls, lowest to highest.

## Morale, Enemy

### Morale Checks

> 2D6 under Morale. Success = enemy enemy flees or surrenders. If Morale = 12 never succeed.

Check **Morale** if the enemy is outnumbered, outclassed, or reduced to half STR (in number or HP.)

------

## Morale, Hireling

> **Retainer Morale** = 2D6 under Morale.
> Success = hold ground. Failure = flee or surrender.

------

## Multiple Attackers

A 10' wide hallway allows two characters to fight side-by-side.
