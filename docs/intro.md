# Village Folk RPG

by Michael R. Bacon. 

Inspired by endless other stuff, but mostly B/X and the Goblin Laws Of Gaming.

Feedback requested!

# Incomplete sections

Please contact me if you can help with any of the following:

* The equipment list isn't ready to use.
* Classes need updating.
* The Random Starting Items table is barely even started.
* The advice sections are almost entirely stolen without credit from random places. I think it's great advice, but I need to replace it with my own or with something that is credited.
* The Professions table is just stolen. It needs to be replaced.

## Structure of Document Sections

> Formulas and summary notes which are useful if you've already read. They're also good for copying and pasting onto a GM screen.

Full length explanation.

Examples and advice.

## Project Goals

1. A rules document that focuses on quick and easy reference, especially for experienced players.
2. Remove rules whose benefit is not worth the hassle, especially if they're about combat. Minimize bookkeeping.
3. Flavor/guidance will be kept to a minimum until the rules are in place.
4. 

## To-do

1. Create a professions table.
2. Create a death and dismemberment table.
3. Fork a set of rules that fits my setting. (This probably won't happen until a lot more of my content is written - maybe a long time from now.)

## Notes

Very GLOG-gy. Many of the mechanics are from http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/the-glog.html by Arnold k. and https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2018/01/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v01-rat-on.html by Skerples.
