# Casters

Starting Equipment: spellbook, ink, quill. Some schools may give additional items.

Starting Skill: see Backgrounds

A: +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +2 Spells (1-6), Spell Breeding 

B: +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +1 Spell (1-8), Book Casting 

C: +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot +1 Spell (1-10), Friendly Spell 

D: +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, Master of Magics 

You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Spell Slot for each Wizard template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each.

When you first gain a Wizard template, you must choose a school from the list below. You cannot change schools later.

As you level, you will gain spells from your school’s spell list. You still can learn and cast spells from outside your school, but until you cast them 8 times, MD spent on them only return on a 1, rather than a 1-3.

**Spell Breeding**
You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:
a) a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)
b) a random spell from a random spell list
c) a [mutant ](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/mutant-spells.html)version of one of the two spells

When the process is complete, Save or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus to Save for
a) every 1 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade
b) the number of Wizard templates you possess

c) each ritual preparation you describe to the GM
d) the number of times you'd previously cast the spells you are combining

**Book Casting**
You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. You must declare you are casting a spell from a book before initiatives are rolled for the turn. You automatically go last in the initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.

**Friendly Spell**
Choose 1 spell you know and have frequently cast. Apply a positive [mutation ](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/mutant-spells.html)to the spell. Do not roll on the drawbacks table, even if the mutation requests that you do.

**Master of Magics**

Learn up to 6 spells from your school’s spell list, or invent an entirely new spell (GM’s discretion.) 



### Chartered Wizards vs. Outlaw Wizards

Some schools of magic have royal charters. They are protected by law in many kingdoms. Their pedigree is established, their students (while raucous and troublesome), are predictable, and their utility in war or in peace is undeniable. However grudgingly, they are allowed a place in the[order of the world](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html.) Chartered schools also charge ruinous tuition, requiring the use of Wizard Student Loans.

Other schools of magic are outlawed. Biomancy and Necromancy are seen as perversions of the natural order. Holy texts and church doctrine state that wizards dabbling in the arts of twisting the body or raising the dead must be killed on sight. In practice, Creation is vast and the times are disordered. There are many places an outlawed wizard could hide.
There are some schools that are neither outlawed nor chartered. According to the law-makers they do not exist. These "Outsider" schools move through society's weave easily, because society has no hooks in them.
Once you have selected a school, roll on the corresponding Background table. You could easily say that your school is Chartered... in Foreign Parts, or that your wizard was trained by an outlawed wizard instead of a proper master. 

### Backgrounds

#### Chartered Wizard

You were trained at a college of wizards. When you weren't drinking, knife-fighting, fornicating, and skipping class, you learned a few spells. You have taken on Wizard Student Loans. You graduate owing 1d10x5000gp, unless your background states otherwise. You owe 1/500th of your total loan amount per month, payable in gold, new spells, magic item, intelligence, slaves, or dragon meat to your college. They will usually give you six months without payment before hunting you down and shaking you until you rattle.
1. You were a foundling, given to a chartered college as part of a town's ancient agreement. Your survival was unexpected but welcome. You start with the "History" skill and many useless facts. You took on a new name to reflect your school, such as "Peter Purplestripe" for Purplestripe College, or "Fredegund Tower" for the White Tower of Elderstone.
2. You are a child of a prosperous merchant. Your Wizard Student Loans are a mere 2,500gp. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill listed. Your parents are disappointed in you no matter what you do. 
3. Your village scraped together enough money to send you, the cleverest child in a dozen generations, to study. Start with the "Farmer" skill and a family. Expect [terrible letters from home](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2017/02/d100-terrible-letter-from-home.html.)
4. Your studies were progressing well, but you suffered a terrible setback. Gain a scar (see the Death and Dismemberment table) and a fear of some innocuous thing, such as lettuce, rain, beeswax, or mirrors. Start with the "Literature" skill. 

5. You have just - within a few days - agreed to become a War Wizard (or Wizard Ordinary.) Start with the "Literature" skill and 1d6 rumours about the [War](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-dont-you-know-theres-war-on.html.) 

6. A lord sponsored your studies. Your lord pays your wizard student loans as long as you work for him in whatever capacity he had planned. Start with the "History" skill.

#### Outsider Wizard

You exist on the edge of the law. While society has no fixed place for you, it does not actively seek your destruction. This is a minor distinction; for the purposes of the Estates, you are either an Outlaw, or a member of the [Third Estate](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html) who keep their abilities disguised.

1. You were tutored in a small group by a wise wizard. You know 1d4 other students from your school well enough that they'd answer your letters.Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill and item listed.

2. You were inducted into an ancient, secretive tradition. Start with the "Poisoner" or "Artist" skill, a dagger, and a secret handshake or sign.

3. You were exiled from your home for openly practicing your magical arts. Start with the "Farmer" skill and 2 rations.

4. You owe secret allegiance to a lord, and have served him in the past in matters best kept from the Chartered wizards. Start with the "Courtesy" skill and 5sp. 



5. You once offended a powerful bishop. Start with the "History" skill and a powerful enemy.

6. You somehow acquired a [camp follower](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/6hv3qi/1d100_table_of_camp_followers/.) You might have saved their life, or they might owe you for a past service, or  you might have caused some minor disaster in their life. Start with the "Soldier" skill or roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill listed.

#### Outlaw Wizard

1. You took up the forbidden arts to avenge some monstrous wrong. Roll at least once on [this table](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2016/02/d100-how-i-was-wronged-by-that-villain.html.) You care nothing for life or those who would judge you. Start with the "Frontier" skill and 5sp.
2. You willingly put your soul on the line while spellcasting. You may add +1 MD to any spell you cast, but you automatically generate a Mishap. This extra MD does not return to your pool. Start with the "History" skill.
3. No matter your abilities, you consider yourself a terrible wizard, a lousy fighter, and a bad friend. Start with the "Poetry" skill.
4. You left your master to face the mob and fled as the villagers lit the pyre. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill listed. You also start with 1gp and nightmares.
5. You experienced a terrible magical catastrophe. Start with the "Bandit" skill. You gain a +2 to Save vs Fear, but the survivors or victims of the catastrophe may still seek you.
6. You have a secret mission. You can choose to decide your mission's goal during character creation, or you can declare it at any time during play. If you succeed, you get 50 bonus XP and a deep sense of satisfaction. Start with the "Cultist" skill and a dagger.

### Mutant Spells

Spells are creatures, not techniques.  You cannot prepare three copies of one spell (unless you have three copies in your spellbook).  You do not learn spells, you lure them.  They are alive in every sense of the word.

They are like ethereal birds that nest in your spellbook, are loaded into your brain, are fired like a bullet, and then return to your spellbook before dawn.

And so it only make sense that there are species, carnivores, parasites, and mutants.  Let's talk about the mutants.

Whenever you find a random spell, roll a d100.  If the result is 1-20, it is a mutant and you should consult the Random Improvements Table below. 

You'll notice that the table actually goes up to 30, but the only way to get results 21-30 is through mutate spell.


Lie Sang Bong F/W 2009
Random Improvements Table

1-2 Improved Effect.  The spell does more of whatever it does.  5d6 damage becomes 6d6, charm becomes obsession.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

3-4 Improved Range.  The range of the spell improves.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

5-6 Improved Area of Effect.  The spell affects a wider area, or more targets.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

7-8 Improved Duration.  The spell improves its duration.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

9-10 Improved Applicability.  The spell affects a broader category of targets.  Charm person becomes charm biped.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

11 Recyclable.  After being cast, the spell has a 50% chance of immediately returning to your brain.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

12 Petite.  The spell takes up a lower level slot.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

13 Elongate.  If the spell is successful, a weaker version will jump to an adjacent area or target.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

14 Facile.  You can cast the spell as a free action.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

15 Hard.  Targets get -4 to their Save.  Roll on the Drawbacks Table.

16 Subtle.  You can cast this spell quietly and without being noticed.  Roll on the Drawbacks Table.

17 Graceful.  You have more control over your spell.  You can create gaps in your fireball, for example.  Roll on the Drawbacks Table.

18-22 New Flavor.  The spell changes elements or orientations.  Fireball becomes lightningball, protection from evil becomes protection from good, charm person becomes charm bird (or perhaps infuriate person), web becomes freedom of movement.

23-24 Spellborn Homunculus.  Your spell becomes a person (read this).  They are neutral towards you.  Roll a random personality and goals.

25-26 Full Sentience.  Your spell becomes fully sentient.  It talks to you.  Roll a random starting personality and goals.  If it is angry at you, it may refuse to be cast.  If it is especially pleased, it may enhance itself in a way that you request.  Spells enjoy being in your brain and seeing out your eyes.  They do not enjoy being in the spellbook, which is much like a jail.  They may request (or plot) their release, or the release of all your spells.

27-28 Breeding.  Your spell has just given birth.  This newborn spell is a weaker version of its parent, but after being cast 5 times it will have grown to adulthood.  Roll a d100 to see if it has mutated from it's parent breed (the same as encountering a new spell in the wild).

29 Spell Fusion.  Your spell has fused with another spell in your head, rolled at random.  Fireball + cure light wounds becomes cureball (which is broken as all hell, but just roll with it).  Charm person + heat metal becomes charm fire (and once you befriend a fire, it will do favors for you).  Cure wounds + cause wounds becomes summon miniature black hole (because that's like dividing by zero or something).  If there is no other spell in your head to fuse with, your spell dies of loneliness.  The dead spell will linger in your head forever.  It will not take up a spell slot, but you will forever be aware of it rotting in there, like an opossum under your porch.

30 Fusion With You.  Your spell has fused with you, probably with your head.  You permanently lose access to that spell slot.  On the upside, you gain some thematic benefit.  Protection from evil might give you a small halo and immunity to possession, or it might invert and give you a ghoul claw complete with paralysis.  If the DM is unable to think of anything more interesting, then you can merely cast that spell 2/day.

Random Drawbacks Table

1-2 Worsened Effect.  The spell does less of whatever it does.  5d6 damage becomes 4d6, charm becomes placate.

3-4 Worsened Range.  The range of the spell worsens.  A helpful spell with a range of 'touch' is reduced to 'self only'.  Reroll if this would reduce a damaging spell's range below 'touch'. 

5-6 Worsened Area of Effect.  The spell affects a smaller area, or fewer targets.  Reroll if this would reduce a spell to fewer than 1 target.

7-8 Worsened Duration.  The spell shortens its duration.  If the duration is instantaneous but creates a permanent effect (such as with knock or cure light wounds), the spell's effect becomes temporary.  For example, the door would relock itself and the wounds would reopen after 10 minutes.

9-10 Worsened Applicability.  The spell affects a narrower category of targets.  Charm person becomes charm man or charm dwarf.

11 Hungry.  The spell requires a unique reagent or focusing item.  This item always takes up an inventory slot.

12 Flaccid.  Targets get +4 to their save.

13 Dawdling.  The spell takes one round to go into effect.  For example, a magic missile that wanders around Family Circus-style before hitting its target.

14 Exhausting.  You are stunned for one round after casting this spell.

15 Maddening.  You take 1d4 Wis damage when you cast this spell.

16 Aneurysm.  You take 1d6 damage for every two levels of the spell.

17 Fat. The spell takes up a higher level slot.

18 Fussy.  The spell can only be cast under certain conditions (time of day, environment, etc).

19 Unreliable.  The spell has a 2-in-6 chance of fizzling.

20 Erratic.  The spell has a 1-in-6 chance of going off in a random direction or targeting a random target (including yourself).

New Spell: Mutate Spell

Pick a spell that is in your brain, roll a d30, and consult the Random Improvements Table, above.

It might be better to give the players a couple potions of mutate spell, instead of a spell they can cast over and over again. 



And yet, some of these table results require some fast thinking on the DM's part.  What's a different flavor of knock anyway?

Here's what I recommend.  Make a list of as many options as you can in 10 seconds, and then roll one at random.

So, to use the knock example. . . knock is basically open door, so maybe open hand?  Or open mind?  Or open chest?  <rolls d3, gets a 2> The spell is open mind.  Maybe it's a bit of a stretch, but the spell can now cause close-minded people to reconsider a different viewpoint.  It allows for fresh reaction rolls or Charisma checks.

## Animist Wizard

Also known as witches. These are the *bad *wizards, the ones who live in shacks on the edge of town or castles on the edge of reality. They are the cursed ones, robed in black, who you seek when all other hopes fail. When the Church turns its back on you, when you scream curses into the night, when your very soul burns, then you are in need of an Animist Wizard... or ready to become one.

> **Perk:** If someone makes a bargain with you and breaks it, Save. If you pass, you instantly know about it. Your spells can target parasites and unborn children without targeting their hosts.

These two perks are strong contenders for the best ones around. What counts as a "parasite" is up to the GM.

> **Drawback**: You are feared and distrusted by most. You cannot bathe. You can never return another person's love.

A good GM will play up the fear and impurity an Animist Wizard carries with them. People make the sign against the evil eye when you pass. Shops close. You will never find true love unless you renounce your class and powers, although you might find corrupted substitutes.

Cantrips: 

The first cantrip is the [strangest ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vgSMFLt_No)and most emblematic. You become a creature of corruption, of black ooze and terrible swiftness. The second cantrip is for parlour tricks and ambushes. The third gives you  direct sense of corruption and impurity. You might not want to know.

### Spell List:

1. Powerful Presence
     **R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [dice] hours
       The caster seems to grow in magnificence and poise, and gains +2x[dice] bonus to Save vs Domination, Charm, or Fear effects. Easily frightened creatures (horses, mice, guilt-ridden murderers) must test Morale or flee before the caster.

A very minor fear-like effect combined with a long-duration buff. This is stage magic. You grow 2" taller and are much more sinister.

2. Telekinetic Shove
     **R**: 50‘ **T**: creature or object **D**: 0 
       An object or creature within range is hurled through the air. Save to negate. A human-sized creature travels 10’ per [dice], and takes 1d6 damage for every 10' traveled. A creature thrown at another creature requires an Attack roll to hit and inflicts 1d6 damage for every 10' traveled. This spell will also blow open all the closed but unlocked doors in a room, shatter all the windows in a building, or knock the thatched roof off a peasant's shack.

No one riding a horse or crossing a bridge would underestimate this spell. 

> 3. Shrivel
>      R. 50' **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: 1d6 rounds / permanent
>        Target Save negates. Target loses half of its current HP and loses 6 Strength (affecting the damage it deals.) When the spell ends, the lost HP and Strength returns. If you cast this spell with 3 or more [dice] against a single target, the lost HP does not return, and the Strength damage is permanent. The apparent age of the target increases considerably for the spell's duration.

 This spell can be used to threaten rather than kill, but it's a powerful threat. [Like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8zf3Mf8CBs), but in reverse. Obviously this needs to be cast with dramatic hand gestures.

> 4. Control Water 
>      **R**: 50’ **T**: a bucket’s worth of water **D**: concentration 
>        Control a small amount of water within 50’. At one [die]: (a) propel a small boat, (b) carry a small item through the water, (c) allow someone to swim at 2x speed, (d) force someone to swim at half speed, (e) splash something no more than 5' away, (f) dry something that is wet, (g) freeze a small amount of water, (h) cool a hot cup of tea. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects.

Good luck adjudicating this one, but you get the idea. With 4 [dice] you should be able to sink a ship or turn back a river. Something equivalent to a full-blast fireball. Water elementals carry means of purifying corruption, and Animists know their secret ways.

> 5. Sleep 
>      **R**: 50' **T**: [sum] HD of creatures **D**: 10 min / permanent 
>        Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap (a standard action.) Non-alert, unaware targets are not allowed a Save.  If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

You can't cast this spell on an apple, but you can use it to save someone from a famine, the pain of death, or other horrible fates. You can also use it to put goblins to sleep. It's a classic.

> 6. Charm Person
>      **R**: 50' **T**: person **D**: [dice] hours 
>        The person regards you as a good friend and ignores the obvious spell you just cast on them. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.

So not dragons, dryads, owlbears, ants, elementals, or angels. People. If it's worried about taxes, gossips, and wears pants, it's a person. This effect overrides the drawback of being an Animist Wizard, but not for long.

> 7. Dream Eater
>      **R**: 50‘ **T**: creature **D**: 0 
>        A sleeping creature within 50' takes [sum] damage. The caster heals for the same amount. No save. When you gain this spell, if you don't know Sleep already, you learn it the next time you would roll to gain a spell. It replaces one of the spells you'd roll for.

A nasty, petty sort of spell that provides some rare healing in this system. You're eating a poor creature's soul, or at least, the interesting parts of it. This spell doesn't work on creatures that don't dream (snails, worms, bureaucrats.) 

> 8. Scorching Ray
>      **R**: 100' **T**: creatures or objects **D**: 0 
>        Fire a ray at a target, dealing 1d10 fire damage with a successful attack roll. Each dice you invest in this spell allow you to fire an additional ray at the same target or at a new target. Creatures are not set on fire, but very flammable objects such as candles, dry straw, or paper will catch fire 1 round after being struck. Instead of using this spell to deal damage, you can instead use it to light all the candles in a single room.

The fire conjured by an animist wizard is a dark and greasy sort, an outcast elemental. 

> 9. Scry 
>      **R**: [dice]x100' **T**: point in space **D**: concentration 
>        You conjure an invisible, intangible, floating eyeball to a point in space that you designate. Unlike most spells, you do not have to have line of sight to cast it. As long as you maintain concentration, you can see through this sensor with your normal senses. This spell requires something to scry on, usually a mirror, quiet pool, clouds, or bonfire. If you invest 2 or more [dice], you can also hear through the sensor (it grows an ear.) If you invest at 3 or more [dice], you can also speak through the sensor (it grows a dribbly little mouth.) If you use an actual crystal ball when casting this spell, the range is instead [dice] miles. Crystal balls are rare enough that they are never offered for sale, but are worth upwards of 3,000gp. Most are ancestral relics.

I like the idea of a horrible dribbly little homonculus flying around and spying on people.  

> 10.Alter Self
> **R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [dice]x10 minutes 
> Alter your form to resemble that of another creature of your type (usually humanoid.) You do not gain any special abilities from this transformation.

You can't alter your smell, and you can't hide from Wizard Vision or an angry mob forever.

**Emblem Spells**

> 11. Doom
>        **R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: concentration 
>        Target feels cold. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, and you loudly pronounce doom on them for the next 2 turns (without being interrupted or breaking line of sight), target dies on the 3rd turn. You need to truly hate the target for this spell to work, or convince yourself that you hate the target. Even a sliver of pity cancels the spell.

You can kill anything with this spell. You might need to test Wisdom or Charisma to prove you really hate a target

> 12. Curse
>        **R**: 50' **T**: mortal creature **D**: permanent
>        You inflict a Minor or Major curse on the target. For a minor curse, you must invest 2 [dice]. For a major curse, you must invest 4 [dice]. Dice used to cast this spell are automatically exhausted. You cannot dispel your own curses.

The tables at the end of the post list some example curses.

> **Mishaps **
> 1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
> 2. Take 1d6 damage 
> 3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a save. Permanent if you fail. Resembles your transformation. 
> 4. Blind for 1d6 rounds 
> 5. Deafened for 1d6 rounds 
> 6. Spell targets you (if harmful) or enemy (if beneficial) or fizzles (if neutral.)

The Mishap table isn't too severe, but the last result is unique to Animist Wizards and represents your spell rejecting you and your goals. Nice work. 

> **Doom of the Animist **
> 1. Some aspect of your transformation manifests for 1 day. 
> 2. Some aspect of your transformation becomes permanent. You become crueler and greedier. 
> 3. Your transformation becomes permanent. You become bestial and monstrous. You become a dangerous NPC. 

This doom can be avoided by true love, or by slaying the last of a powerful species (black dragons, elder trees, creation elementals, abandoned gods.) 
Your transformation grows to corrupt you, or your corruption grows to transform you. Difficult to say. Eventually, you're going to turn on your friends and devour them. True love requires you to love someone back, and that means giving up your powers forever.

### Curses

I stole some of these curses from [here](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2015/01/d20-curses.html), and others from... other sites. I can't remember where. Anyway, they are only examples. Roll randomly, pick a curse, or inflict something thematic.
Cursed people need to have their curse identified (by a priest, a hermit, a madman, a fairy, etc..) Identification also reveals the way to remove the curse. You can also try all sorts of risky exorcisms and rituals to get rid of the curse instead. Some of the effects seem severe, but remember, they could be "just die" instead. Curses should be appropriate to the target, their sins, and the caster's whims.

### Minor Curses

1. Dog hatred. They will attack you, if given half a chance. Cured by living as a dog for 1 year, or doing 1 dungeon or equivalent challenge "as a dog".

2. Will never find love. No one wants to sleep with you. Cured by helping 2 other people fall in love.

3.Absurd Speech. Cannot be comprehended by anyone. Spells have a 60% chance of failure and a 10% chance of Mutation. Cured by learning a language you have never heard before.
4.Fragile. Any damage dealt to you may be rerolled, and the higher result is kept. Cured by voluntarily breaking all of your fingers and toes. 
5. Twitchy and Freakish. -2 to all Reaction rolls when you are in a party. Can be cured by having a baby within wedlock and treating it well. 

6. Foggy eyes. Cannot see more than 30'. Cured by serving a crone for 1 year. 

7. Nightmares. Only get restful sleep 60% of the time. Cured by sleeping alone in a dungeon or other very dangerous place. 

8. Hiccups. Always fail stealth checks. Never surprise anyone. Cured by suffering a genuine fear effect (doesn't count if cast by friends.)
9. Grim hearted. Can never benefit from positive morale or positive emotions. Cured by helping a bunch of children (big donation to an orphanage, saving child slaves, etc.)
10. Dreamlessness. Reduce all XP gained by 5%. Immune to bad dreams. Cured by insanity. 

11. Delicious. Monster that enjoy eating people will prioritize attacking you. Can be cured by eating an entire manticore.
12. Hollow Guts. Consume three times the usual rations, and must eat something every three hours or suffer 1d6 damage. Cured by eating deadly poison. 
13. Flashing eyes. Your eyes glow in different colours. They cast light like a match. Always fail stealth checks unless you move blindly. Cured by staring at the sun for 1d4 hours. Save each hour or be permanently blinded. 
14. Horrible Nickname. Everyone who meets you knows your new horrible title, and they might believe it. Cured by convincing someone to adopt your full name, and taking theirs. 
15. Sticky. You attract insects. Each day the swarm grows. Insects eat half your allotted rations each day. Cured by scraping your entire body with a silver spoon.
16. Curse of bad luck. -2 to Save. Can be cured by sacrificing a bull atop a mountain.

19. Blighted. Crops and animals do not thrive when sharing a property with you. No fruit, no milk, etc. Cured by planting 1000 trees by hand. 
20. Sour Milk. 50% chance that food turns rotten in your mouth (chance of wasting a ration.) Cured by fasting for 2 weeks.

### Major Curses

1. Go with the Flow: All bones are dissolved. You are now a sack of liquid that must be carried in a bucket. Reroll all physical stats using 1d6. 20% spell failure chance. Cured by eating the bones of an ogre. 

2. Made of glass. Any noise louder than a conversation requires you to Save vs Fear. Cured by deafening yourself with hot iron needles in the ears. 
3. Doomed. Will automatically fail the next Save vs Death. Cured by the touch of a wight.

6. Evil Twin. An exact duplicate appears 1d6 miles away, with all the same gear, items, and knowledge, but of opposite alignment. They hate you. Ends only in the death of one or both. 
7. Spirit Home. A small creature takes up residence in your skull, carving a tiny hollow for its home. It crawls out from your ears at night to bring home food and small items. Cured by tempting the creature out with a more interesting head. 
8. Beloved by the Dead. Anything dead within 20’ of you has a 50% chance of coming to life every 2 hours. Radius grows by 5' every day. They love you and seek to make you like them. Cured by immersing yourself in a vat of holy water for 1 full day. 
9. Cursed Bloodline. A minor curse is applied to all your blood relatives, or those you consider family. 
10. Mute. Cannot cast spells. Can be cured by plucking out an eye and sacrificing it to a god. 
11. Ophelia. Save or try to drown yourself in any body of water you encounter. Cured by poisoning someone you love, or someone who loves you. 
12. Weightless. Each day, you weigh half as much as you did the previous day. You also halve your melee damage each day. After 6 days, you begin to float. Cured by plucking the wings off one fairy for each day since you were cursed. 
13. Bad with money. 20% chance to lose all money when entering a settlement (via thievery, taxes, etc.) Cured by sacrificing your most valuable possession.

17. Cursed to die in a fire. Fire does double damage. Cured by killing a dragon, or serving one for a year and a day.
18. Moon curse. Turn into an (NPC) werewolf 1 random night during the week of the full moon. Cured by drinking hemlock (Save vs Poison or die.)
19. Endless Thirst. Water and ale provide no hydration. You must drink magic potions. Failure to do so means death by dehydration in Con Bonus -2 days. Cured by the spinal fluid of an Aboleth.
20. Curse of Unreality: 50% chance to disappear when not observed, and reappear 1d6 hours later. Cured by writing a popular ballad or book about your exploits.

## Biomancer

**Perk: **When you drink a potion, you have a 50% chance to recycle it via whatever orifice you prefer. You have 10 minutes to excrete the potion. You start with two black thumb rings (the secret mark of your profession) and a random potion. 
**Drawback: **Whenever you receive magical healing, Save or gain a mutation. The regeneration spell does not trigger this. 



**Cantrips**
1. Transfer a blemish or cosmetic feature from one creature to another. You could swap eye colours with an elf or pull warts off a toad and put them on a princess. You cannot transfer significant effects (poison glands, wings, etc..)
2. Taste blood to tell what kind of creature it came from. 
3. If you wish, your appearance will no longer age. Once you activate this, you will always look the same age. This may fail in times of dire stress. 
     The potion recycling perk is fairly useful, but your friends may not be willing to try the recycled potion. Magical healing is fairly rare in my setting so the drawback is less dangerous. The cantrips are a bit odd. If you'd like, roll 20+3d20 for your actual age. 

### Biomancer Spell List

2. Alter Self
3. Animate Potion
4. Extract Venom
5. Shrivel
6. Hand of the Hound
7. Infantilize

8. Monsterize
9. Regeneration
10. Blood Jelly
      Emblem Spells 
11. Wave of Mutilation

12. Mutate



1. Acid Arrow
     **R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: 0 
       Target takes [sum] damage, and [sum-4] damage over the next 2 turns unless washed.

2. Alter Self 
     **R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [dice]x10 minutes 
       Alter your form to resemble that of another creature of your type (usually humanoid.) You do not gain any special abilities from this transformation. 

3. Animate Potion

**R**: touch **T**: potion or liquid **D**: [sum] hours

You turn a potion into an obedient homunculus (HD 0.) It is tiny (1' tall) and feeble (Str 1), but it can go where you direct and even bring you small items (like a single coin.) The potion can be delivered by touch or by “drinking” the homunculus. Aware targets can swat the homunculus away to avoid the potion's effects. Works on any liquid except water.

4. Extract Venom

**R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: 0

You pierce a creature with a sharp object and draw all of the venom out, which then pools in your hand or a vial. If you use this to remove the poison from a poisoned creature, that creature gets a new Save with a +4 bonus. You can also use this to draw all of the poison out of a venomous creature. Unwilling venomous creatures may Save to negate this effect. Most biomancers keep one of their fingernails razor sharp for this purpose.

5. Shrivel

R. 50' **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: 1d6 rounds / permanent

Save negates. Target loses half of its current HP and loses 6 Strength (affecting the damage it deals.) When the spell ends, the lost HP and Strength returns. If you cast this spell with 3 or more [dice] against a single target, the lost HP does not return, and the Strength damage is permanent. The apparent age of the target increases considerably for the spell's duration.

6. Hand of the Hound

R. self **T**: one or both hands **D**: 10 minutes

Your hand falls off and grows into a monstrous version of itself: 
HD: [dice]

Attack [dice]+d10
Defense 14 
Strength 16

You continue to control it, but if it dies, you don't have a hand anymore. Alternatively, you can have this affect both hands, but you’ll look quite foolish.

7. Infantilize

**R**: touch **T**: creature of [dice]x2 HD or less **D**: [sum] minutes 

Target Saves or becomes an adorable, if slightly eerie, child version of itself. Creatures lose 1 HD (-6 max HP, -1 to hit, -1 to Save.) The target's Strength is reduced by 5. The target is now so adorable that all who see it must Save the first time they try to harm it or hesitate. If they fail this Save, they can act normally the next round.

8. Monsterize*

**R**: touch **T**: creature with 0 HD (vermin) **D**: [sum] minutes

Target vermin (rat, scorpion, termite, etc) becomes huge and aggressive. 

HD: [dice]x2 
Attack: [dice]+d10 
Defense: 12 

Monstrified vermin attack the nearest foe, and casters usually throw the vermin as they cast this spell. Works on goblins and other low HD monsters. There is a 1-in-10 chance that this spell will be permanent. If you invest 4 [dice], the creature also mutates.

9. Regeneration

**R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: [dice] hours 
Target regenerates 1 HP every 10 minutes. If a sufficiently magical object (a troll heart, a unicorn horn, an aboleth eye, etc.) is used in the casting, target also regrows missing limbs or damaged organs. 

10. Blood Jelly

**R**: touch **T**: meat (1 ration's worth) with some of your blood on it and the blood of up to [dice] other people **D**: permanent
You touch dead meat or a pool of blood and create a tiny blood jelly. It starts as the size of a thimble. It's is transparent with a red spidery nucleus. It won't harm anyone who contributed blood to its creation. 

The blood jelly will react the same way you do to any potions or items fed to it. It's a great guinea pig. If it stays small and you feed it an entire potion, you can consume it to also gain the potion's effect.

The more you feed a blood jelly, the larger it grows. They lose 10% of their weight each day, and gain 10% of whatever they eat in weight, and it takes an hour to eat something as big as they are. They have 1HD per doubling past 100 pounds and their default attack is sucking 1d4 points of blood per HD they have. Given 1000 pounds of meat, a fist-sized jelly takes about a day and a night to reach 100 pounds and 1HD. The more magical and unusual things you feed to it, the stranger it will become. 

11. Wave of Mutilation
       **R**: 30' **T**: objects **D**: 0

Everything in a 30' cone takes [sum] slashing damage. This spell leaves dozens of deep cuts. It shreds clothing, paper, and other fragile items.

**12. Mutate** 

**R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: permanent

Save negates. Save once per mutation. Target gains [dice] random mutations. If the creature chooses to fail its Save, roll double the number of mutations, and the caster chooses which half are gained. 

**Mishaps **
1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
2. Take 1d6 damage 
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save with a -4 penalty. Permanent if you fail. 
4. Agony for 1d6 rounds.
5. Ravenously hungry. Cannot cast spells until you eat 1 ration.
6. Slough skin. Takes 1d6 rounds to remove. Is disgusting. 
     **Doom of the Biomancer **
7. Your appearance shifts and randomizes for one day 
8. Save at the start of each day or gain a mutation. Save at the end of each day or that mutation becomes permanent. 
9. You become a [Chaotic Psychoplasm](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2015/01/chaos-flesh-metachaotic-psychoplasm.html.) 
     This doom can be avoided by eating the hearts of 100 species, or by falling in love with the same doppleganger three times, or by tattooing rare fixative runes all over your body. 

## Door Wizard

Wizards of the Door

To become a Door Wizard, go mess around with portals and extradimensional spaces.  Alternatively,  seek the elves (the only remaining practitioners of the teleport spell.)

The Rules

Restrictions
You must never imprison a living creature, or allow one to be imprisoned. You must never harm a  door, or allow one to be harmed.

Boons
You begin the game with a skeleton key.  It unlocks the keyhole on your chest.  If unlocked, your  chest can be safely opened and your heart removed.  This doesn't harm you, but you must obey any  creature that holds your heart.

You can cast a version of the knock spell that involves pushing your skeleton key into a creatures  sternum (requires a successful attack roll.)  The creature takes [sum] damage on a successful save,  and dies on a failed save (as most creatures die when you messily open their rib cage.)  (This  requires you to cast the knock spell normally, by memorizing  it from your spellbook.)

The room created by your secret room spell becomes enlargable and decorateable. Each dungeon key you feed it creates a new 400 sq. ft. room shaped however you wish that holds up to two pieces of furniture and/or decoration.  The created room, furniture, and decorations all match the style of the dungeon that generated the key.  (Only keys found in dungeons have this ability.)  At the DM's discretion, very important keys may generate NPCs within the secret room.

### Spells List

GLOG Wizard Rules: Players begin with two spells from this list generated by rolling d6. When they research a new spell, they roll a d12.  Spells #13 and #14 are rare spells, and are as rare as magic weapons in your game.

1. Knock
2. Lock
3. Map
4. Secret Room
5. Speak With Lock
6. Emergency Exit
7. Command Door
8. Summon Door Hound
9. Wall of Doors
10. Secret Chest
11. Transpose
12. All Things Adjacent

**Rare Spells**

1. Portal
2. Teleport

### Spell Descriptions

**All Things Adjacent**
**R**: 0
**T**: self **D**: 1 turn

You are adjacent to all things within your line of sight.  You can punch anything you could see. You can pick up any object and put it in your pocket as if it were beside you.  However, you are affected as if you were in every location at once.  (To put it in grid-based combat terms, you are affected by all effects effecting every observable square.)  You do not suffer multiple effects from the same hazard (even though you are standing in all parts of a wall of fire, you only take its damage once.)  Obviously, casting this spell within sight of the sun is instantly fatal.

**Command Door**
**R**: 50'
**T**: door
**D**: until midnight splittable

Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent open, belts come undone. A door becomes your loyal servant until midnight.  This spell only affects doors that have been tamed (unlocked, detrapped, opened, and passed through.)  Larger doors may require more casting dice (2 dice = double doors, stone doors, 3 dice = metal doors, enormous doors, 4 dice = magic doors.)  The door will obey your verbal commands to open/close, lock/unlock, disarm/arm, and even attack.  An average wooden door deals 1d8 damage and attacks as a HD 4 creature.If you control multiple doors within the same dungeon, you can cast this spell while investing 3 dice to link them together for 10 minutes.  Whatever enters one door exits the other.  You can decide which side of which door leads to which side of which door.

**Emergency Exit**
**R**: touch
**T**: [sum] objects **D**: 0

Up to [sum] touched objects and/or creatures are teleported out of the dungeon.  They arrive safely, but are all scattered within 1 mile of the dungeon's primary entrance.  Each carried item has an independent 5% chance to be similarly scattered.

If used in a building, it will eject all objects and/or creatures from random entrances (each rolled separately.)

If used in a city's streets, it will eject all objects and/or creatures from random entrances (each 
rolled separately.)

**Knock**
**R**: 50'
**T**: object **D**: 0 splittable

Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent open, belts come  undone. Treat this as a Strength check made with a Strength of 10 + ([dice] * 4.) Worn armor falls  off if the wearer fails a save. Creatures must save or vomit (a free action.)

**Lock**
**R**: 50'
**T**: object
**D**: 10 minutes splittable
Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door, chest, or similar object, it  will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing through it and then trapping them. This spell works on things that aren't technically portals (for example, a sword could be locked in its scabbard.) When resisting being opened, the object has an effective Strength of 10 + ([dice] * 4.)

Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature's orifice, or paired orifices; the creature gets a save to resist, and another save at the end of each of its turns.  (This works on eyes, mouths, nameless sphincters, etc.)

**Map**
**R**: 0
**T**: self
**D**: 0
You get a brief vision of the surrounding rooms in the dungeon.  Not the contents--just the topology.  The DM reveals [sum] random, adjacent, non-secret rooms that are so far undiscovered.  Just draw it on the players' map.  If used in a city, it gives an accurate map of the city, with more dice resulting in a higher level of detail.

**Portal**
**R**: 20' x [dice] 
**T**: 2 surfaces 
**D**: [dice] rounds
You create a pair of linked portals, each attached to a flat, immobile surface (such as a wall or a floor.)  Anything that passes through one portal passes out the other, with momentum being conserved.  You can create a door beneath a creature, but they get a Dex check to avoid falling 
into it.

**Secret Chest**
**R**: 0
**T**: self
**D**: 10 minutes

You can access [dice] extradimensional chests, each one having 3 inventory slots.  The chests are ordinal, i.e. you can only access the third chest by investing three casting dice.  (You cannot switch chests around.)

**Secret Room** 
**R**: touch
**T**: wall 
**D**: varies

A touched wall grows an extradimensional room.  This takes 30 minutes.  Behind the door is an empty 
20' x 20' room of matching architecture.   The room lasts for 2 hours, doubling in duration for 
each invested die.  At the end of the duration, all objects inside the room are ejected.

**Speak with Lock**
**R**: 50'
**T**: lock
**D**: [dice] minute

You can talk with locks.  Locks tend to be practical and no-nonsense.  Trapped locks are liars. 
Locks remember everyone who ever locked or unlocked them, but their descriptions might not be 
useful (since they mostly center on descriptions of their hands and personalities-as- 
expressed-by-turning-a-key.)  Picking a lock is a terrible sin to them, but it is the only sin.
Many believe the form determines function determines morality.

**Summon Door Hound**
**R**: 50'
**T**: conjuration  **D**: concentration
You summon a houndlike creature that obeys your commands.  It has stats as a wolf except that it 
has HP [sum] and deals +[dice] damage.  It can teleport 50' once for every dice invested beyond the second.

**Teleport**
**R**: touch **T**: objects **D**: 0
Up to [sum] touched objects and/or creatures are teleported to a random room within the dungeon.  
If cast within a building, they are teleported to a random room.  If cast within a city, they are 
teleported to a random building.
It is possible to cast a version of this spell that allows for targeted teleportation, but it 
requires 10 minutes, a well-known destination, and affects half as many creatures/objects.

**Transpose**
**R**: 50'
**T**: 2 objects
**D**: 0

Pick two very similar objects.  They switch places.  Attended/worn/held objects are allowed a Save. 

DM's discretion as to what counts as 'very similar' but they are encouraged to invent a fail 
chance for borderline cases.

**Wall of Doors**
**R**: 50'
**T**: conjuration **D**: 10 minutes

You create a rectangular wall composed of 10' x 10' panels arranged in a flat plane.  You can conjure a total of [dice] panels.  You can orient it however you want.  It has [sum] HP.  You can  control who and what can pass through the wall.  (For example, a wall of doors could be used as a  bridge; allies can run across safely while enemies would fall through suddenly open doors.)

## Drowned Wizard

In your [father's time, or perhaps in his father's time](http://www.strangehistory.net/2016/07/27/perhaps-fathers-time/), the city of Anostos was swallowed by the sea. For all their power, wealth, and learning the mage-citizens of Anostos could not avoid their fate, and so drowned along with their libraries and towers. 

It happened so far away and so long ago that it might as well be a myth to most people, but it really did happen, although the true story is slightly more complicated than the moralizing myth. Anostos was a city of wizards, ruled by magic, with charms and enchantments for every occasion. Its citizens lived in peace and health. Protected on all sides by the sea, its ancient towers contained books from the dawn of creation and treasures from the forgotten past. They claim to have invented the sail, the rudder, the waterwheel, iron, and coins.

No one is entirely sure what happened, or why, but two facts are perfectly clear to the survivors. First, the ocean fell in love with the city. This is a literal and very real love. The sea is fickle and vast and getting it to do anything is nearly impossible, but it did love Anostos, and it claimed it for its own. Second, the mages of Anostos were dragged immediately to Hell. 

This is why they are called drowned wizards by the irreverent masses. The ocean loves them and wants to drown them, and if they drown, they will go to Hell. 

Some mages were away from their city when disaster struck. In secret monastaries and towers they try to keep their traditions alive, but they are a shattered school, bent and warped by schemes of world domination and secret power. The wealth of Anostos is gone, and with it, the legions of mercenaries, collectors, secret societies, and spies that once bowed to its throne. You practice secret rituals to hide yourself from the ocean.

**Perk**: You can cast spells silently. You inherit a decrepit and badly maintained spy network. If you are broke, 1d10 cp will appear in your mouth once per day.

**Drawback**: Cannot drink water. Other water-based liquids, such as beer or tea, are fine.

You start with 1d6 days worth of tea leaves or one bottle of wine. Tea leaves cost 2cp per day but can only be purchased in a city.

**Cantrips:** 
1. Convince another creature that anyone who dies by drowning will instantly go to Hell. This is what Drowned Wizards believe. Lasts 1 hour.
2. Cause a loud bell to ring from somewhere due north. Only you can hear the bell.
3. Meditate for 1 hour to gain a new Save against any ongoing mental effect.

### Spell Descriptions

As a Drowned Wizard, your spells are ancient magic, the remnants of a world-shaking tradition. You keep your mind tidy and your spells domesticated. They are tools, nothing more. 

1. Command Coins

**R**: 30’ **T**: [sum]x100 coins **D**: [dice] hours
Coins will leap up and obey your single-word commands. Affects all unattended coins in 30' of you and lasts 1 hour. Coins can be commanded to follow you, hide in crevices, or serve as rollers for heavy statues, but they are mindless and feeble.

The coins can only roll along the ground or jump small distances.

2. Detect Gold

**R**: 100’ **T**: self **D**: [sum] minutes
The spell name is misleading, as this spell simultaneously allows you to identify all precious metals. You see them through walls and barriers as faint shifting afterimages, but the spell bleeds into you other senses.

If you cast this spell with 3 or more [dice], your eyes turn gold and the effects are permanent. You cannot sleep within 100’ of any adamantium. The screams keep you awake.

3. Magic Missile

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0 Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As a Drowned Wizard, your spell is a coruscating bolt of pure magic, cast with appropriate hand gestures.

4. Desiccate

**R**: 30’ **T**: creature **D**: 0
Hydrated target within 30' takes 1d6 + [dice] damage. Can also be used to turn meat into jerky or concentrate water-based liquids (wine, most acids), up to 2 gallons per [dice]. You can make a cup full of very strong brandy from a bottle of wine.

5. Grease

**R**: 50' **T**: object, surface **D**: [dice]x2 rounds
Can be cast directly on a creature or a 10' x 10' x [dice] surface. All creatures affected must Save vs Dex or drop held objects, or, if moving, drop prone.

6. Slam Portal

**R**: 100’ **T**: door or doors **D**: 0
Slams a door shut and/or locks it (if it has a lock.) Most wooden doors will get stuck shut, and require a Strength check to open. Works on any number of door within 100', but only doors. If you invest 2 or more [dice] and target a single door, it becomes magically locked for [sum] hours. If you invest 3 or more [dice], you may magically lock any number of targeted doors for [sum] hours.

You can undo your own magical locks, but you can't relock them without recasting this spell. You can't pick a magical lock and bashing the door down takes more effort.

7. Light
     **R**: touch **T**: object or creature **D**: [dice]x2 hours
       Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous.

8. Metal Chime
     **R**: touch **T**: metal object **D**: [dice] days
       You touch and enchant a piece of metal to make a terrific noise the next time it strikes a solid surface or is struck. All creatures within 30' (except you) must Save or be deafened for 1 minute. If used as a signal, it can be heard up to a mile away.

9. Spite 
     **R**: 50‘ **T**: creature **D**: [sum] varies
       No save.

Whenever the target creature would roll a critical success, it becomes a critical failure instead. Target will also feel anxious and irritable for the spell's duration. Duration: 1 [dice]: rounds, 2 [dice]: days, 3 [dice]: weeks, 4 [dice] months.

10. Fog
      **R**: 30’ **T**: self **D**: [dice] hours
      You breath out a bunch of fog. Everything up to 30' away from you is obscured. Sunlight, wind, or heat dissipates the fog in 10 minutes. If you cast this spell with 3 or more [dice], other casters lose 1 MD while they remain in the fog.

#### Emblem Spells:

11. Mighty Lungs
       **R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: 0
       Your next inhalation allows you inhale 10x the normal amount of air. Not only does this allow you to hold your breath for 10x as long, but if you exhale forcefully it will release a blast of air strong enough to knock pigeons out of air and polish your teeth. A human-sized creature travels 10’ per [dice], and takes 1d6 damage for every 10' traveled. A creature or object blown at another creature requires an Attack roll to hit and inflicts 1d6 damage for every 10' traveled. This spell will also blow open all the closed but unlocked doors in a room, shatter all the windows in a building, or knock the thatched roof off a peasant's shack. If you cast this spell with 3 or more [dice], Save or your teeth shatter.

12. Magic Cramp
       **R**: 100’ **T**: creature **D**: 0
       Target takes 1d4 damage plus 1 damage per the maximum number of magic dice they possess, or 1 damage per HD for seriously magical creatures (unicorns, dragons, etc..) Additionally, they lose [dice] MD for [dice] rounds. Save for half damage and to negate the caster level penalty. Nonmagical creatures, or creatures that have no spellcasting ability, are unaffected by this spell.

#### Mishaps:

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours
2. Take 1d6 damage
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4. Blind for 1d6 rounds
5. Deafened for 1d6 rounds
6. Vomit 1d100 litres of seawater.

#### Doom of the Drowned Wizards:

1. You can no longer swim. You cannot cast spells if you are touching free-flowing water (not damp socks, but a puddle.)
2. Save vs Fear whenever you encounter a body of water larger than a teacup.
3. The tide will rise to your current location, and then drag you down. Expect 3d20 merfolk or drowned corpses and one 1d10+8 HD sea monster or [dragon](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-chromatic-dragons.html.) It will be the storm of the century. Anyone drowned along the way will join them.

> This doom can be avoided by discovering a secret unknown to anyone, including the ocean, or by visiting Hell and leaving a decoy behind, or by somehow disguising your soul forever.

On the other hand, the Dooms are fittingly severe. At first, water elementals, called by the sea, sap your magic... or just terrify you. It might all be in your head. But then the ocean comes to claim you no matter how far away you are from the ocean. It's a miniature personal apocalypse. Survive it by accumulating secrets the ocean doesn't know (it loves secrets too), or by hiding.

## Elementalist Wizard

Elementalist Wizards speak to and rely on elemental spirits. They are a wild bunch, disreputable and windblown. In rural areas, they are beloved as rain-bringers and flood-calmers, but they are also run out of town or hung following forest fires and earthquakes. 

**Perk:** +3 to Save or Defense vs Elemental damage. No bonus against non-damaging effects.

**Drawback**: Cannot cast fire spells if wet. Cannot cast water or ice spells if dehydrated. Cannot cast earth or acid spells if you are not touching the ground. Cannot cast air or lightning spells if you do not have line of sight to the sky. 

**Cantrips: **
1. You gain Elemental Vision for 1 hour by meditating for 1 hour. 
> You can sense the potency and disposition of any nearby elemental spirits. The ground appears to be made of interlinked stone bodies. A campfire is a jolly spirit devouring logs. Clouds appear as fat naked people rolling through the sky. You can speak to the spirits - you always could, anyone can - but when you are attuned like this, they are more inclined to listen. They won't obey you, and they may be hostile, but they may also offer advice, tell tales, demand offerings, or simply ignore you. 
2. Summon a flame the size of a candle's by snapping your fingers. Cannot be used to deal damage. Only exists for a few moments but may be used to start a fire. Range: 10'.
3. Meditate for 1 hour to gain a new Save against any poison or choose another damaging effect.

**Mishaps: **
1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
2. Take 1d6 damage 
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a save. Permanent if you fail. 
4. Soaked, or dehydrated, or flung upwards, or buried. 
5. Deafened for 1d6 rounds 
6. Wild elemental spirits flee your body for 1d6 rounds. Everyone within line of sight must Save each round or be stunned


**Doom of the Elementalist:**
1. Take sufficient elemental damage to reduce you to zero HP. 

2. Each time you cast an Elemental spell, Save or the spell flies out of control. If it likes you, the effects might not be too bad. The longer it's been sitting around un-cast, the less it likes you.

3. The elements turn against you. Expect 1d4+4 powerful spirits to arrive shortly. In the meantime, fire chases you, stones seek to crush you, the earth trembles, and lightning bolts plunge from the sky.

This doom can be avoided by journeying to a powerful elemental centre and pledging yourself to the spirit within, or by visiting pure vacuum or the deepest shadow. Shadow and vacuum can cut the ties that let elementals identify you.

### Spell List:

Elementalists are very close to their spells. They name them and treat them like pets. It's possible that your spells breed, or age. Maybe your *circle of frost* spell is carried by the children or slaves of your *wall of ice *spell.

For spells with [element] listed, you can choose the element. If you'd generate a duplicate of a spell with the [element] tag as you gain Wizard templates, you may either reroll the spell, or choose a different element. There's no rule that says you have to be consistent in your element choices, but it will probably happen naturally.

> 1. Circle of Frost
>      R: self T: [dice]x10’ radius D: 3 rounds 
>        All creatures in area take 1d4 damage, Save vs Reflex for half. Everything that fails its Save is frozen to whatever surface they were touching. Boots are frozen to the ground, keys are frozen in their locks. Creatures are usually immobilized from the boots down unless they were playing in a fountain or something. Attempting to break loose is a free action that can be attempted once per round, and requires a successful opposed Strength test. The ice has a Strength of 10 + [dice]x2.

> 2. Control [Element] (Elemental) Pick one of the following elements. Control Rain is a bit of an odd exception, but it was too good not to include in this list. I'd say the effects increase more or less exponentially. At 4 [dice], Control Earth should let you dig a moat or build a hill, like a proper crazy wizard. Control Air at 4 [dice], could push a small fleet of ships, or summon up the North Wind itself to freeze an army.

> Control Air  
> R: 50’ T: a gust of wind D: concentration 
> Control a gust of wind within 50'. At one [die], use wind to (a) clear away fog or gas, (b) extinguish a fire no larger than a torch, (c) blow all the papers off a desk, (d) with concentration, provide enough of a breeze to power a tiny sailboat. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects.   



> Control Earth 
> R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of earth D: concentration 
> Control a small amount of earth within 50'. At one [die]: (a) excavate a bucket's worth of dirt, (b) smooth and fill the same amount, (c) causing the earth to quickly swallow a small item, or quickly swallow a non-resisting person, chest, or signpost, (d) exhume something at the same rate, (e) knock over some hobo's shack with a tiny tremor. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects. 
> Control Fire 
> R: 50’ T: a torch’s worth of fire D: concentration 
> Control a small fire within 50’ At one [die]: (a) cause a fire to double in size, power, and brightness, (b) create a huge amount of smoke, (c) extinguish a fire no larger than a torch, (d) have a small ember (0 damage) jump 1' off the fire, (e) ignite something that is meant to be burnt, such as a match, cigarette, or fuse, (f) heat up a cup of tea to a pleasant temperature. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects. 
> Control Rain 
> R: 1000’ T: self D: [dice] hours 
> If it's raining, you can make it not rain for 1000' around you. If there's not a cloud in the sky, this spell has no effect. If it's cloudy, you can make it rain for 1000' around you. Most days have a 40% chance of being cloudy. Cannot be cast indoors. 
> Control Water 
> R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of water D: concentration 
> Control a small amount of water within 50’. At one [die]: (a) propel a small boat, (b) carry a small item through the water, (c) allow someone to swim at 2x speed, (d) force someone to swim at half speed, (e) splash something no more than 5' away, (f) dry something that is wet, (g) freeze a small amount of water, (h) cool a hot cup of tea. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects.



> 3. Dissolve 
>      R: 50' T: object or creature D: concentration 
>        Target you stare at takes 1d4 acid damage per round and begins to dissolve. Save vs Con for half damage. Can bore holes in walls, but it only makes a hole 1' and creates a lot of acidic sludge on the floor. [dice]”/10 minutes through stone, [dice]”/minute through wood, cannot affect metal. Heals slimes and oozes for 1d4/round.



> 4. [Element] Breath 
>      R: [dice]x20‘ cone T: area D: 0
>        Does 1d4 damage to anything in the cone. Save vs Con for half damage. Wind or Water breath extinguishes all fires smaller than a big bonfire. Fire breath sets very flammable things on fire. Acid breath bleaches the colour from objects and irritates the eyes.



> 5. Stoneskin 
>      R: touch T: creature D: 10 min 
>        Reduce all physical damage the target takes by [dice]x2. The target cannot swim, jump, or run.



> 6. Anklecrusher 
>      R: 50' T: [dice]x2 objects or creatures D: 0 
>        Target creature or object is grabbed by the ground itself. Target takes 1d6 damage and is immobilized. Save vs Dex to negate, prone creatures automatically fail. Target is immobilized until it can win an opposed Strength test against the ground. The effective Strength of the ground depends on what it is made out of: Dirt 8, Clay 12, Limestone 16, Basalt 18. This spell has no effect on things that aren't touching the ground.

An Elementalist will start with 2 of the 6 spells listed above (generated randomly.)

> 7. Protection from [Element] 
>      R: touch T: [dice]x[dice] targets D: 10 minutes / 8 hours 
>        Reduce all damage of the chosen type by 4 for the next 10 minutes. Alternatively, the spell protects its targets from the negative effects of the element (desert heat, arctic chill) for the next 8 hours.

The effect is caused by summoning little counter-elementals. For example, if you wanted to protect against cold damage, the Elementalist would summon a swarm of tiny fire elementals to warm the hair and skin of their allies.

> 8. Ignite 
>      R: 50' T: object or creature D: 0 
>        Target object or object takes [sum] damage and catches on fire. Save negates.



> 9. Breathe [Element] 
>      R: touch T: [dice] creatures D: 2 hr 
>        Target can breath in the chosen element, in addition to their normal modes of respiration. Clearing your lungs before the spell expires is mandatory. Does not grant you protection from that element, just from drowning in it.

 

> 10. Wind Scythe
>
> R: 50' T: object or creature D: 0
>
> Apply a melee attack from a slashing weapon in your hand to a target within 50’. If you are unarmed, counts as a dagger (1d6.) Gain +2 to Attack and deal +[sum] damage.



> 11. Wall of [Element].
>        I'm not sure what a "Wall of Acid" or "Wall of Ice" would look like, precisely, but I'm pretty sure that I could use 3 walls listed below to figure them out in a hurry.

> Wall of Earth
>
> R: 20’ T: wall D: permanent
>
> You rearrange dirt to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The wall has Defense 2 and [dice]x2 HD. If it is horizontal, the wall must be anchored on at least 2 sides.
>
> Wall of Fire
>
> R: 20’ T: wall D: 1 minute
>
> You summon fire to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The wall does not block line of sight. It deals 1d6 fire damage to anything that passes through it. Save vs Dex or be set on fire.
>
> Wall of Wind
>
> R: 20’ T: wall D: 1 minute
>
> You summon wind to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The wall does not block line of sight. Powerful winds will knock small projectiles out of the air and prevent vermin (anything smaller than a rat) from crossing. Ranged attacks that pass through the wall get [dice]x-3 to hit.



> 12. Shocking Grasp 
>        R: 0 T: self D: 10 min 
>        You enchant your hand so that it discharges [sum]+[dice]x2 damage worth of lightning into the next thing you touch. Touching an unwilling opponent requires an Attack roll against their unarmored Defense. You cannot wear any metal on the hand you enchant. If you deal more than 12 damage, you and your target must both Save or be flung apart, knocked prone, and deafened for 1d6 rounds.

## Elf Wizard

> **Perk**: Gain 1 extra MD while touching a tree at least 50`high. Roots count. You start with a bow. 

 The bow is more important than it sounds. As a low-level elf wizard it will be your only source of damage. The extra MD can potentially be amazing. There aren't many ways to get extra MD in this system and 50' trees are surprisingly common.

> **Drawback**: If you are scarred, disfigured, or filthy you must Save each morning or be unable to cast spells that day.

 But here's the big downside. Sleep rough, wake up grubby, and stop being an Elf Wizard for the day. Lose a leg? Get a bad rash? You're effectively demoted. Watch out.

> **Cantrips: **
> 1. Create a pleasant musical ringing sound. 
> 2. Any target you hit with an arrow counts as being at range “Touch” for the purposes of your spells. 
> 3. Touch a wound to prevent it from bleeding. You do not negate any damage, but you to stop blood loss (and remove the Blood Loss condition.) Faint white scars will still form.

Your cantrips are decent. The 1st has many uses. As one of my players said, "When the donging stops, the elf is dead."

In this setting, spells are creatures. Wizards have brain-guns that shoot bullet-ferrets. Elves do things a little differently. Their spells are naturally generated, symbiotic creatures bound to their soul and substance. They still need a spellbook, because you want to keep your spells safe, but their books are elegant gossamer creations embroidered with platinum thread. An Elf Wizard is like a magical sculpture garden or a music box. They are made for entertainment. To a High Elf, that can mean a lot of different things.

### **Spell List**

Some of these are stolen from [Goblin ](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2015/02/elven-warbands.html)[Punch](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2014/01/even-more-monastic-wizards.html.) 

> **1. Clarity**
> **R**: 30’ **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: 0
> Target makes another Save against a emotion-affecting effect (fear, anger, sadness, pleasure, pain.) This can affect yourself.

Elves view the world through schoolteacher eyes.

> **2. Speak with Birds**
> **R**: 200’ **T**: birds **D**: 20 minutes
> You can talk to a bird, and it can talk back. If there is a party of 3-6 adventurer's moving through the forest nearby, a random songbird has a [sum]x10% chance of knowing where they are and if they're doing anything extra weird. Birds of prey are rarer, but more observant.

It's "speak with birds" not "make friends with birds". Your average forest songbird will happily sit on an elf's shoulder and tell them all sorts of Disney-branded secrets. Your average mountain eagle will show up, demand food, scream at you about politics and all the people and sheep it's killed, and then leave in a huff.

> **3. Blossom **
> **R**: touch **T**: plant **D**: permanent 
> Touched plant flourishes. Seeds germinate, flowerbuds swell and bloom, and a sickly plant regains vigor. Heals [sum] HP to a plant creature. If cast on a fruit, the fruit will grow up to the maximum normal size or 2x as big (whichever is smaller.) Yes, you can use this to double your rations, as long as your rations are fruit or vegetables.

Elves, in this system, also eat half the usual rations (1 per day rather than 2.) Using it on food would be a shame though.

> **4. Illusion of Youth **
> **R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: [dice] days, or, if [sum] > 12, permanent (until death)
> Touched creature is cloaked with an illusion that makes them appear to be in their physical prime.

Elves age slowly, but their last few decades condense a lifetime of ugliness. This spell cloaks you or your companions. You'll probably want to cast if before meeting a High Elf. Remember, you can't "see through" illusions, but you can pop it with a good solid blow.

> **5. Locate Animal**
> **R**: [dice] miles **T**: creature **D**: [dice] hours
> Name a common animal. You now know where the nearest example of the animal is.

Oh hooray. If the areas is infested with manticores, they count as common creatures.

> **6. Unseen Orchestra**
> **R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [sum] minutes 
> You are surrounded by the harmonious sounds of a five-piece band for the duration of the spell. The exact instruments vary caster to caster, and the unseen band can play any song you've heard before. It cannot duplicate speech. You can also opt to center the effect on an adjacent location, rather than on yourself.

Bear in mind that you start with 2 of the 6 spells listed above and a bow. Good luck, Elf Wizard! 

> **7. Floral Salvage**
> **R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: 0 
> Flowers (caster chooses the type) erupt from the target's wounds. Target takes 1 damage for every point of damage it has already taken, not exceeding [sum]x2. Save for half. If this damage kills the target, their corpse is entirely consumed by plant growth, and turns into a beautiful tree covered in flowers. Height is 2d4 x creature's HD in feet.

And then, possibly as soon as Level 2, Elf Wizards go from "princess jukebox" to "double fireball to the face". Bear in mind that with the bow-related cantrip you can hit a target with an arrow, deal 1d6 damage, and then cast this spell to (at a bare minimum) double your damage. You also get a tree out of it.

> **8. Beautify**
> **R**: touch **T**: creature or object **D**: [sum] hours >6 permanent 
> Target made more beautiful. Dirt falls away, pimples disappears, teeth whiten, lice vanish, gouges fill in, and varnish looks new again. Will also restore 1d4 points of Charisma if damaged, to former max.

 While *Illusion of Youth* is merely an illusion, this is the real deal. You won't get any younger but you and the things you own will look as good as new, or possibly better. Expect Elf Wizards to cast this on themselves openly (just in case), and on their allies (secretly, if required.)

> **9. Magic Missile**
> **R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0 
> Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no save. As an Elf Wizard, you have to fire this spell using a bow. The spell is the arrow.

I don't have much to say about Magic Missile, except that it's clearly an Elf spell humans domesticated.

> **10. Serpents of the Earth (Elf) **
> **R**: touch **T**: section of natural soil or stone **D**: concentration 
> [Sum] enormous serpents of HD 1d4 crawl up from the dirt. They have Attack 13, Defense, 13 and deal 1d6+HD damage, except for the 1 HD serpents, which are small and bite for 1 damage + deadly poison. Serpents are not controlled by the caster. They're just pissed off snakes.

The Authority buried the Primordial Serpents deep within the earth, but Elves know how to call them up again. This is not always a wise idea.

**Emblem Spells **

> **11. Elegant Judgement**
>
> 
>
> **R**: 200' **T**: 20’ diameter **D**: 0
>
> Does [sum] damage, Save vs. Charisma for half. Like a fireball, but the flames are purple and gold. Creatures with 17 or more Charisma, non-sentient creatures, beautiful objects, the dead, or other Elves are immune to this spell.

More straight up-damage... or is it? I'm sure there are other uses for this spell.

> **12. Rain of Arrows**
> **R**: 200' **T**: 20’ diameter **D**: 0 
> Does [sum] damage. As fireball except that the caster fires an arrow into the air (which turns into a multitude) and the damage is all piercing damage. Doesn't work in places with low ceilings (less than 100'.)

Another straight-up damage spell. Really, you're only likely to pick this one if you aren't taking *Elegant Judgement* or* Magic Missile*. It's here to give you options.

If an Elf Wizard can survive to Level 4, they will become one of the more formidable damage-dealing casters in the game. Early levels do not give them tools for survival. It's a very risk-reward setup.

> **Mishaps:**
> 1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
> 2. Take 1d6 damage 
>      3.[ Random mutation](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2017/05/faerie-mutations.html) for 1d6 rounds, then make a save. Permanent if you fail. 
> 3. Agony 1d6 rounds 
> 4. Blind for 1d6 rounds 
> 5. Lose one MD for 24 hours.

Nothing too shocking here. This is one of the less harsh mishap tables.****

> **Doom of the Elf Wizar**D**: **
> 1. Lose the ability to cast spells for 1 day, 
> 2. Lose the ability to cast spells for 3 days. Lose the ability to fire a bow or draw a blade for 3 days. 
> 3. Lose the ability to cast spells permanently. You can wield only your nails and teeth. You can only speak in monosyllables.

> This doom can be averted by winning the trust and patronage of a powerful High Elf, or by building a tower near some site of astounding natural beauty.

The Doom list is less forgiving. You slowly regress to a less enlightened form. Your carefully crafted substance is unraveling. The magic of a High Elf can save you, or your own sense of beauty and truth will keep you together. Otherwise, you'll collapse at the seams.

## Garden Wizard

Everyone's favorite kind of [wizard](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-class-wizards.html.) If you live in a feudal society where crop failure can result in total existence failure, having someone around who can talk to plants, move trees, and get crops to grow is incredibly valuable. Nobles sponsor them; up-and-coming merchants and landowners want to marry them. Peasants leave them gifts and come to them with all sorts of problems. Alone, among wizards, they are beloved.
Except by [druids](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2014/09/7-myths-everyone-believes-about-druids.html.) The garden is the antithesis of the forest. Gardens are shrines to domesticated plants. A big wheat field is impressive, but a garden is a tiny segment of the wilderness made perfect and smooth. Dogs are tamed wolves. Gardens are tamed forests. We tell stories about how real life ought to be, and we build gardens to make nature the way it ought to be.
Some ideas stolen from [here](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2014/01/even-more-monastic-wizards.html.)

### School: Garden Wizard

**Perk: **You gain +1 Attack stat and +1 Defense while wielding a quarterstaff. You start with a quarterstaff, a spade, and a good pair of boots. 

**Drawback:** You must meditate each morning within sight of natural beauty. Even some mold growing on a rock counts. You must describe this to other players. Druids hate you. 
A "good pair of boots" takes up one inventory slot, but provides bonuses to climbing slippery surfaces and kicking monsters in the goolies. The meditation portion is very entertaining, especially if the Garden Wizard is played by an actual biologist who is *just delighted* to tell everyone about the mysteries of lichen and the thirty identical varieties of wintergreen.
**Cantrips: **
1. Permanently change the colour or form of a small plant.
2. Plants grow just a little bit better in a [level] mile radius around you. It takes at least a season to be noticeable. 
3. You can sleep anywhere, in any position, with a few moments notice. You can set environmental conditions that will wake you, such as “sunrise” or “rain.” 
     The garden wizard cantrips aren't very impressive, but changing the form of plants is more useful than you might think. Hand someone a rose, then change it to a brilliant blue (to match their eyes.) How many people could resist that? Also, the radius of growth is based on your actual level, not the number of wizard templates, so if you reach level 6 you'll cover over 100 square miles. Garden wizards this potent are very, very rare.

### Garden Wizard Spell List

**1. Clarity**

**R**: 30’ **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: 0
Target makes another Save against a emotion-affecting effect (fear, anger, sadness, pleasure, pain.) You can target yourself.
**2. Woodbend**

**R**: touch **T**: staff **D**: [dice] hours
A bit of wood bends or unbends. Straight doors can be warped and stuck. Warped doors can be straightened and unstuck. Wooden-hafted weapons may become unusable or impose significant penalties. Trees can likewise be molded.

**3. Dendrigraphy** 

**R**: touch **T**: tree **D**: 10 minutes 

Allows you to ask a [dice] questions of a plant that you touch. Answer appears in letters on the trunk. [Trees ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-plants-forests-gardens-and-dryads.html)are fairly intelligent. They know about weather and have a great sense of time, but they have a hard time differentiating between animals, except by size. They also gossip among themselves, and may have gossip from distant lands. This spell also works on Dryads.** **

**4. Whirling Staff ** 

**R**: touch **T**: staff **D**: [dice] rounds
You can cast this spell as a free action. You get +1 Defense while you whirl your staff around with both hands. The next attack you make with the staff does an additional 1d6+[dice] damage and counts as magical. This spell lasts for [sum] rounds or until you attack. You can also throw a whirling staff 60' with a standard attack, dealing 1d6+[dice] damage. It does not return.
**5. Locate Animal**
**R**: [dice] miles **T**: creature **D**: [dice] hours
Name a common animal. You now know where the nearest example of the animal is. If the area is infested with manticores, they count as common creatures. 
**6. Magic Missile**
**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0 Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As Garden Wizard, your spell is an invisible blast of force or a green-white bolt of lightning, cast with appropriate hand gestures. 

**7. Obedient Stone**

**R**: touch **T**: stone **D**: [dice] hours
Cast this spell on a stone small enough to fit in your palm and then give it a command. It will attempt to follow your commands to the best of it's ability. If thrown at a target, it will get +10 to hit (and deals 1d6 damage.) It can also be asked to trip targets when they run past, jump off a shelf when a certain person enters the room, etc. Limited to [sum] small hops or actions. Lasts [dice] hours or until the stone runs out of actions.

------

**8. Control Earth**
**R**: 50’ **T**: a bucket’s worth of earth **D**: concentration 
Control a small amount of earth within 50'. At one [die]: (a) excavate a bucket's worth of dirt, (b) smooth and fill the same amount, (c) causing the earth to quickly swallow a small item, or quickly swallow a non-resisting person, chest, or signpost, (d) exhume something at the same rate, (e) knock over some hobo's shack with a tiny tremor. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects. 

**9. Light **
**R**: touch **T**: object or creature **D**: [dice]x2 hours
Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous. 
**10. Sleep**
**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: 10 min 
Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap (a standard action.) Non-alert, unaware targets are not allowed a Save. Can affect creatures up to [sum] HD. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

**Emblem Spells **

------

**11. Wall of Earth **
**R**: 20’ **T**: wall **D**: permanent 
You rearrange dirt to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The wall has Defense 2 and [dice]x2 HD. If it is horizontal, the wall must be anchored on at least 2 sides. 
**12. Uproot **
**R**: touch **T**: tree **D**: [sum] rounds 
You touch a tree or [sum] of smaller plants, and they  uproot and march to a new location. If you invest 3 or more dice, they march until you tell them to stop. Otherwise, they root themselves when the spell’s duration ends. Trees move 6’/round, smaller plants move 12’/round.

**Mechanical Notes on the Garden Wizard Spell List**

Garden Wizard spells are a mixed bag of area control, direct damage, and utility spells. This class is a solid all-rounder. The +1 to Attack and Defense while holding a quarterstaff, combined with spells like *whirling staff* and *magic missile*, makes the Garden Wizard a decent fighter, but they never reach the flashy levels of ludicrous power available to some of the other classes. Strangely enough, aside from *dengrigraphy*, they can't speak to plants. *Speak with plants* is a spell they need to adventure to learn.

**Mishaps **

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
2. Take 1d6 damage 
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail. 
4. Plants wither for 5xd20 feet around you. 
5. Save vs Fear against fire for the next 24 hours. 
6. Plants erupt from your fingers and toes. Everyone within 50’ must Save vs Dex or be entangled and slowed. 
     **Doom of the Gardener **
7. Take sufficient fire damage to reduce you to zero HP. 
8. You can no longer read maps or symbolic representations of places, or non-magical languages. 
9. Your memory fades. You cannot memorize spells. Save every hour or forget every detail of the previous few hours. 
     This doom can be averted by planting 10,000 trees by hand, and tending them as they grow to maturity. You may also journey to the Heart of the Forest, and battle the wild spirits within.



## Necromancer

Vaguely based on Arnold K's [Necromancer](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/09/the-glog-wizards.html), but heavily adapted.

Necromancers are outlawed and outcast [wizards](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-class-wizards.html.) Their profession is a curse; their very name a byword for unholy acts and blasphemous deeds. Yet the necromancers persist on the fringes of society. They provide a relatively safe channel between the living and the dead, and someone will always pay - one way or another - for information only the dead can provide. In Foreign Parts, the necromancer's art is celebrated and sometimes even revered. One of the standard list of charges brought against foreign kings and corrupt leaders is "consulting with necromancers."

> **Perk: **You can cause creatures you touch to reroll any [Fatal Wounds](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-death-and-dismemberment-table-early.html) they are trying to remove in a round. You can allow them to reroll failed tests or force them to reroll successful tests. If a creature  successfully removes a Fatal Wound because of the reroll you provided, it permanently loses 1 HP.

This perk is fairly valuable in a crisis, especially if magical healing is not available. It's a very good reason to be nice to the necromancer; if you're dying, they can save you... or make sure you don't recover.

> **Drawback:** You require a ritual ingredient to cast your spells. The ingredient has a negligible cost (2cp) and is not consumed, but water, fire, or isolation could render you unable to cast spells. Roll on the Ritual Ingredient List below.

The drawback to this school could become an issue if the necromancer is searched or otherwise inconvenienced.

> **Cantrips**
> 1. You can call on the spirit of a recently dead creature by interrogating its body. Provided the creature died before dawn, and it wasn't particularly pious or exceptionally blasphemous, it will answer 3 of your questions. At dawn, the spirit departs. The dead are rarely coherent or helpful. Answers may be cryptic. If the creature had 3 or more HD, everyone present can see and hear the spirit. Otherwise, only you can see it.
> 2. You can ritually protect a corpse against possession by [unwelcome spirits](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/10/osr-12-new-undead-creatures-of-varying.html.) Alternatively, you can deliberately invite spirits to possess a corpse. The ritual takes 10 minutes. The most dangerous time is between death and dawn; after that, the corpse becomes less appealing to wandering spirits.
> 3. You can permanently lose 1 HP to add 1 MD to a spell you are casting. You can only lose 1 HP per spell.

Necromancer cantrips are very powerful but, in all 3 instances, potentially dangerous. Some spirits might stick around if they are casually called back to answer questions. Inviting spirits into a corpse is asking for trouble. And fueling your spells with your own HP makes lichdom very tempting.

### Spell List

In this setting, spells are creatures. They're spirits that live in a wizard's brain and burst out, doing their duty and then taking a brief vacation. While most wizard schools breed spells specifically, necromancers might keep a cadre of ghosts. Some necromancers cast their own ancestors as spells; some trap escaped ghosts and wield them in a form of holy penance. 
Many spells on this list require a bit of GM improvisation. The spells are much less straightforward than a traditional spell list. They are also dangerous to both the caster and their companion. Raise ye not up what ye cannot put down.****

> **1. Raise Spirit**
> You automatically gain this spell at first level. Roll for your other spell normally.
> **R**: touch **T**: spirit **D**: [sum] minutes  

> After a ritual that takes 10 minutes, you call out to the spirit of a dead person. The spirit can be anyone, from long-dead kings to newly-murdered party members. You do not need the creature's body. This spell can only be cast between sunset and dawn. Roll 1d6 on the table below, modified by the following: 

> **Bonuses**
> +1 for each [die] invested in this spell
> +1 if the spirit died within a week
> +1 if the spirit has unfinished business in Creation
> +1 if you know the spirit's true name
> +4 if you personally knew the creature before it died 

> **Penalties**
> -1 for each of the creature's original HD
> -1 if the spirit was a wizard
> -1 if the spirit is angry or irritated with you
> -2 if you have only a vague name or description
> -4 if the spirit was a necromancer or had significant magical powers in life
> Other bonuses and penalties at the GM's discretion. The stronger the soul, the more dangerous the summon. 

> **Raise Spirit Result**

> **0 or negative:** The spirit is raised, but lashes out in anger and annoyance. You take 2d6 damage. If this damage reduces you to zero HP, you are dragged straight to the afterlife (no Save.) Alternatively, the spirit casts *Fatal Doom* (see below) on you.
> **1.** The spirit is raised, but it cannot be put down. If there is a corpse nearby the spirit will possess it. Otherwise, it will act as a[disembodied undead](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/10/osr-12-new-undead-creatures-of-varying.html) of appropriate HD.
> **2.** The wrong spirit is raised. It may be more or less useful than the intended spirit.
> **3. **The spirit is raised, but its answers are mocking and cruel.
> **4. **The spirit is raised and answers your questions truthfully.
> **5. **The spirit is raised and also provides a useful answer to a question you did not ask.
> **6. **The spirit is raised and remains for 1d6 additional minutes.
> **7 or higher. **The spirit is raised, and can be given one command (as per the *Command Undead *spell below.)

*Raise Spirit* is the [necromancer's signature spell.](https://isthatinthebible.wordpress.com/2017/11/10/spooky-tales-from-the-bible-the-necromancer-of-endor/) It's deceptively simple. Want to figure out who built this temple? Call up the temple builder and interrogate them for a few minutes. Want to find out who killed the king? Call up the king and ask him! What could *possibly *go wrong? Yes, you can use this spell to bypass many obstacles, but the risks are very high. Think of it like an improvised teleport spell. 

> **2. Explode Corpse**
> **R**: 50' **T**: corpse **D**: 0
> Target corpse explodes, dealing damage in a [dice]x5' radius, Save vs Dexterity for half. The maximum damage dealt is dependent on the creature's size:
> Ra**T**: 1
> Dog: 1d6
> Human: 2d6
> Cow: 3d6
> Elephan**T**: 6d6
> Whale: 8d6
> This spell cannot target undead creatures unless you control them.

This is the only direct damage spell available to the necromancer, and it's pretty good. Send zombies shambling towards your enemies and then detonate them. It's no* fireball*, but it is a nasty surprise, and adventurers are rarely short on corpses.

> **3. Death Mask**
> **R**: touch **T**: humanoid corpse **D**: varies
> You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask. The rest of the corpse shrivels up and flakes into dust. When you (and only you) wear the mask, you will look and sound like the person whose face you're wearing, but only to sentient people (no effect on animals, spirits, or elementals.) The mask will rot into uselessness after [sum] days. If [dice] is at least 4, the mask is permanent.

A useful spell at low levels. Half-thief half-necromancer is a decent build. This spell is sure to come in more useful if the necromancer reaches lichdom.

> **4. Fear**
> **R**: 50' **T**: creatures up to [sum] HD **D**: 0
> Target creatures must Save vs Fear or take a morale check, or flee from you. If you cast this spell with 4 [dice], creatures unused to supernatural occurrences (peasants, domesticated dogs, etc.) must also Save or age 2d10 years.

A good solid crowd control effect, but also a great way to properly intimidate lesser wizards.****

> **5. Rot**
> **R**: touch **T**: creature or object **D**: 0 
> Creatures take 2x[dice] damage, Save for half. Creatures also age 2d10 years (no mechanical effect), and may develop grey hair, shakes, and wrinkles. Objects are aged according to how many [dice] are invested. Books sprout into mold, wood becomes soggy, lamps run out of fuel and grow cold, and stone is entirely unaffected. 1 [die]: [sum] days. 2 [dice]: [sum] months. 3 [dice] or more: [sum] years. Undead are healed for [sum]+[dice] HP, or 1 permanent HP is restored (to the former maximum.)

The main effect of this spell is the healing portion. Bolstering undead is very useful, especially if the undead is you.

> **6. Raise Undead**
> **R**: 20' **T**: [dice]x2 HD corpse **D**: 2 hours 
> Target is raised as a specific type of undead that is obedient to the caster. The creature is animated by a specially developed spell or an obedient ghost. When the spell’s duration ends, the undead may collapse, and cannot be raised again or used for any further spells.
>
> The type of undead raised depends on the target and the [dice] invested. 
> 1 [die] : 1-2 HD creature : [corpse snake](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/10/osr-12-new-undead-creatures-of-varying.html), crawling claw, skeleton, zombie
>
> 2 [dice] : 1-4 HD creature : wight
>
> 3 [dice] : 1-6 HD creature : [war spirit](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/10/osr-12-new-undead-creatures-of-varying.html), mummy
> 4 [dice] : 1-8 HD creature : something impressively terrifying
>
> Undead typically have reduced stats compared to their living form. Undead of 5 HD or less are nearly mindless. If you die while undead are under your control, the spell's duration expires, or you try to end the spell, there is a [HD]-in-10 chance the undead remains active. Otherwise, it collapses.

> Instead of letting the spell expire, you can keep the [dice] you spent on the spell invested. The spell's duration becomes permanent as long as those [dice] remain invested. Alternatively, if you spend 4 [dice] to raise a 1 or 2 HD creature, the spell's duration becomes permanent and no [dice] need to be invested. Creatures may retain some special abilities they had in life.

Raising zombie servants is great. Stitching corpses together to make new creatures to unleash on your enemies is great. But raise not up what you cannot put down. An obedient mummy servant is fantastic; a rogue mummy servant is very dangerous.

> **7. Innocent Revenant **
> **R**: Touch **T**: corpse **D**: 0 
> A creature of [dice] HD or less that died in the last 3 turns immediately returns as an undead version of itself with full HP. The HD requirement is ignored if the target is well known to you (a fellow PC, for example.) This revenant can never gain HP, and loses 1 HP, and 1 point of Int and Wisdom to a minimum of 5, every hour until it reaches 0 HP and disintegrates. This HP loss can be healed by the *Rot* spell or other effects that heal undead creatures. The revenant is unaware that it ever died, even ignoring obvious signs of death (no heartbeat, cold flesh, gaping wounds.) However, if someone else insists on confronting them with evidence of their own death, they fly into a rage, becoming a mindless undead.

A necromancer can "accidentally" kill a friend using their class' Perk, then raise them as an *Innocent Revenant,* then heal them with Rot or control them with *Command Undead.*

> **8. Command Undead**
> **R**: 50' **T**: person **D**: [dice] hours 
> Targe**T**: 1 undead creature that can hear and understand you.
> You shout a single-word command to your target, who must Save or obey. If the command lasts more than a single round, intelligent undead, or undead under the control of another necromancer, get a new Save at the beginning of each of their rounds. You can spend additional [dice] to increase the effects.
> +1 M**D**: Affect +2 targets.
> +1 M**D**: You may increase then length of your command by +2 words.
> +1 M**D**: You may increase the duration between checks by +2 rounds.

A more specific version of *command*, but note the targets. Undead you control get one Save; after that, no matter their HD, they must obey. 

> **9. Fog**
> **R**: 30’ **T**: self **D**: [dice] hours
> You breath out a bunch of fog, filing an area [dice]x20' in radius. No one can see beyond 10' in the fog. Undead can see through the fog. If you invest 4 [dice], you can instead breath out a layer of thick grey-yellow clouds that block sunlight for the spell's duration, for 3 miles in every direction.

Undead don't do well in sunlight, and a few zombies can become very effective if their opponents can't see them.

> **10. Death Scythe**
> **R**: touch **T**: corpse **D**: [dice]x10 min The corpse disintegrates as you pluck a black scythe from its chest. The scythe deals 1d8+Strength Bonus damage. It deals double damage to creatures of the same type as the corpse used to create the scythe (so a scythe drawn from a troll's body would deal double damage to trolls.)

This is a relatively high damage spell, but require the necromancer to wade into melee range. 

**Emblem Spells **

> **11. Finger of Death**
> **R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: 0
> Target living creature must Save or die. Creatures with a significant magical nature gain a bonus equal to their HD. Frail mortal creatures may not get a Save. This spell requires 2 [dice] to cast against a creature of 5 HD or less, 3 [dice] for a creature between 6 and 8 HD, and 4 [dice] for creatures with more HD.

There's no bonus for using more [dice] to cast this spell, but it can straight-up kill some creatures instantly. Dragons and other powerful living creatures can shrug this spell off; most mortals can't.

> **12. Fatal Doom**
> **R**: 10' **T**: creature **D**: permament
> You must invest 4 [dice] to cast this spell, and you also drop to 0 HP. You pronounce a Fatal Doom upon a living creature. The creature must have asked you for advice, in a non-casual capacity. They must have asked you what to do, where to go, how to overcome an enemy, or a glimpse into the future. Instead of calling on a spirit,  you read the future directly. You may describe (in one or two sentences, clear or cryptic) what will happen to the target, and how they will die. The Doom is inevitable and irreversible. The GM may alter details and circumstances, but if you say that the target will be hounded from his home by those he loves and devoured by wolves in the forest, that's how he's going to die - and soon. Nothing else will kill the target until the Fatal Doom has come to pass.

This is one of the most powerful spells a wizard can cast because it allows the caster to directly edit reality and set future events. The necromancer could doom a nation with a single spell. Of course, there's no protection from the consequences of a wrathful leader, especially one who has nothing to lose.

**Mishaps **
1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
2. Take 1d6 damage 
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a Save. Permanent if you fail. 
4. Save vs Fear against the target of your spell. 1d6 rounds. Target is fully healed if undead. 
5. 1d6 nearby corpses raise as zombies and attack you for 1d6 rounds. 
6. You die. Save vs Intelligence every hour to find your way back to your body.
     **Doom of the Necromancer **
7. You die and spend the next 1d6 days wandering Creation as a disembodied, feeble spirit. Your body will rot after 2 days unless it is preserved in some way: pickling, embalming, freezing, or desiccation. If you inhabit a rotting body, you become undead. 
8. You become undead, permanently. If you were already undead, you instead lose 6 HP permanently.
9. By direct decree of the Authority, all corpses in 20 miles rise as zombies and skeletons and attempt to kill you. If you have been particularly notorious, they will be accompanied by 2 [Bell Exorcists ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/09/osr-class-bell-exorcists.html)and a [demon](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/10/osr-only-good-demon-is-good-demon.html.) Average: 3d20 skeletons, with 1d6 lieutenants, monsters, and commanders as appropriate. Anyone they kill joins them. They will pursue you to the ends of the earth. 
     This doom can be avoided by eating the heart of an immortal creature, or journeying into hell and make a bargain to serve the Authority, or becoming a Lich. 

**Becoming a Lich**
You need to breed and research 8 specific spells. The spells don't do anything alone, but they modify your soul to withstand the terrors of undeath with your mind intact. You are essentially breeding and then grafting spells onto your soul.
Since no active liches will teach you the spells they used, and records of spell development are fragmentary at best, each lich must forge their own path. Some succeed; many fail, and fade away into half-mad shadows or disappear screaming into Hell. Other liches become trapped in living worlds of madness and memory, unable to accept their new form or the the changing times. History is full of Immortal Tyrants; they never quite manage to rule the empires they desire. 
**Ritual Ingredient List**

4. A round blue stone

5. A piece of carved and polished bone

6. A grey metal bell with no clapper

7. A twig with three forks and one dead leaf

## Orthodox Wizard

**Perk: **You start with red robes. 

**Drawback:** None. 

**Cantrips**

1. Change the colour or texture of an object no larger than a horse for 10 minutes.
2. Create a tiny light as bright as a match on your fingertip. 
3. Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll along the ground or turn the pages of a book, but you couldn't open a door or lift a stone. 

Having no drawback is a rarity, even if your perks and cantrips aren't very impressive. They are good classic *orthodox* cantrips. 

### Orthodox Wizard Main Spell List

An Orthodox Wizard can roll on the** **[**100 Orthodox Spell List** ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/03/osr-100-orthodox-spells.html)instead of rolling on the list below. Results may vary.

**1. Lock**

**R**: 50' **T**: [dice] creatures or objects **D**: 10 minutes 

Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door, chest, or similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing through it and then trapping them. This spell works on things that aren't technically portals (for example, a sword could be locked in its scabbard.) Requires Str 10 + [dice]x4 to open. Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature's orifice. The creature gets a Save to resist, and another Save at the end of each of its turns. 

**2. Knock**

**R**: 50' **T**: [dice] objects **D**: 0 

Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent open, belts come undone. Treat this as a Strength check made with Str 10 + [dice]x4. If target is an armoured creature, Save or armour falls off. If target is an unarmoured creature, Save or vomit for 1d4 rounds.

**3. Grease **

**R**: 50' **T**: object, surface **D**: [dice]x2 rounds 

Can be cast directly on a creature or [sum]10' x 10' surfaces. Creatures moving across the area must Save vs Dexterity or drop held objects, or, if moving, drop prone.

**4. Force Field**

**R**: 10' **T**: plane or sphere **D**: concentration

Creates a shimmering force field, 10‘x10’, centered up to 10' away. Alternatively, create a sphere centered on the caster 5' in diameter (large enough for the caster and +1 person.) The force field has [sum] HP. All attacks against it hit.

**5. Levitate **

**R**: 50' **T**: creature object **D**: concentration 

You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is [dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.

**6. Magic Missile**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0 Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As an Orthodox Wizard, your spell is unique to you, and can be any colour, shape, or pattern you describe. 

**7. Feather Fall **

**R**: 10’ **T**: [dice] creatures or objects **D**: 0 

If you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction to negate it. You float gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly late.) 

**8. Sleep**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: 10 min 

Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap (a standard action.) Non-alert, unaware targets are not allowed a Save. Can affect creatures up to [sum] HD. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

**9. Light**

**R**: touch **T**: object or creature **D**: [dice]x2 hours

Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous. 

**10. Wizard Vision**

**R**: touch **T**: sighted creature **D**: 10 min / permanent

If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see through illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated. 

If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above, except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects: (a) You can forever see invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else. (b) You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes. 

The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6 Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from your peers.) 

**Emblem Spells**

**11. Prismatic Ray **

**R**: 200' **T**: [dice] creatures or objects **D**: 0 

Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes the target. Roll a d10: 1. Red. Target takes [sum] fire damage, Save for half. 2. Orange. Target takes [sum] bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Save negates. 3. Yellow. Target takes [sum] lightning damage, save for half. 4. Green. Target takes [sum] acid damage, save for half. 5. Blue. Target takes [sum] ice damage, save for half. 6. Purple. Target takes [sum] necrotic damage and is blinded for [sum] rounds. Save negates. 7, 8, 9. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one save. 10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times. 

**12. Fireball **

**R**: 200' **T**: 20' diameter **D**: 0 

Does [sum] fire damage to all objects.

### Spell Descriptions

 

**1. Bartholomew's Pit**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target creature has the illusion of falling into bottomless pit filled with accusatory voices. Save negates. If they fail, the creature is stricken with a deep depression (if sentient) or lethargy (if mindless), and takes [sum] Charisma damage. If they are of [dice] HD or less, the effect lasts [sum] days, and if [sum] is greater than 12, the effect is permanent. If the target has more than [dice] HD, the effect lasts [sum] rounds.

**2. The Razor Spiral**

**R**: Self **T**: [dice]x10' radius **D**: concentration

Blades of invisible force fly around the caster. All creatures in area take 1d4 damage each round the spell is maintained. Roll damage for each creature individually, starting with those closest to the caster. The spell ends automatically when [sum]+3 damage has been dealt. The blades will also cut or damage fragile objects in the area.

**3. Oxhold's Lament**

**R**: 120' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target creature of [dice] HD or less must Save vs Fear or take a Morale check, or believe that someone close to them has suddenly and tragically died. They will not associate the caster with this death, but intelligent creatures may believe the caster is only informing them to cause them grief.

**4. Negasonic Ray**

**R**: [dice]x20‘ cone **T**: area **D**: concentration

Rippling rings of purple light pour from the caster's forehead. All sounds are cancelled within the area of this spell. Creatures are deafened until the spell ends or they leave the spell's area. 

**5. Summon Candles**

**R**: touch **T**: object **D**: 5 minutes / 3hrs

[sum] dribbly candles appear on objects you touch. You can walk around placing candles as required, for up to 5 minutes. The candles are lit and burn for 3 hours. They can be detached, but will fade from existence within 5 minutes. If any spells are cast within an area illuminated by a summoned candle, the candle's flame will turn blue and point to the caster.

**6. Perilous Bridge**

**R**: [dice]x100' **T**: object **D**: 1hr

A shimmering bridge of force appears from an object the caster touches, and extends, perfectly level, in a single direction. Both ends of the bridge must touch solid objects. The bridge is 1' wide and thin as a sheet of paper. Slowly walking across it does not require a Save vs Dexterity, but running or a slight breeze will require one. The bridge shatters if it is dealt any damage. 

**7. Wending Bolt**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target takes [sum] damage. You do not need to see the target, but you do need to know their approximate location (within 10'), and there must be a clear path a bolt could trace to reach them. The path can be as convoluted as required. The bolt can pass through gaps as small as a fist.

**8. Thunderclap**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Target takes 1d6 damage. All creatures within [dice]x10' of the target are deafened for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the effect is permanent.

**9. Compartmentalize Mixture**

**R**: touch **T**: object **D**: 1hr

Command a mixture of items (a soup, a pile of coins) that weigh no more than [dice]x100lbs to separate into [sum]+1 categories. The separation is slow, and hindered by even the slightest effort. The categories must be clearly defined and identifiable by inspection. For example, you could split a soup into "vegetables" "broth" and "poison", or a pile of coins into "minted during the last century" and "older". You could not, however, split a pile of coins into "handled by Xerphion the Tyrant" and "not handled by Xerphion the Tyrant", as there's no way to tell just by inspecting them. You could not separate "a locked chest" and "its contents", because the items could not flow freely into separate piles.

For example, you could fire a magic missile straight through the cube at a target 30' away from the cube.

The wind flows out at the same rate it entered. If you activate this spell in a light breeze for 5 minutes, the spell will release a light breeze over 5 minutes. The wind only flows from the circle, so anyone standing behind it is not affected (unless you release hurricane-force winds indoors.) You can cancel the release at any time, which expends the spell as usual. If you die while this spell is "loaded" and in your brain, it activates facing a random direction.

The creature's Stats and HP are quartered when transformed into a small creature and halved when transformed into a medium creature. When the spell's effect ends, the creature is stunned for 1d6 rounds. 

**67. Horsebane**

**R**: 100' **T**: area **D**: [sum] rounds

A circle 20' in radius becomes sticky and soft. Creatures in the area move at half speed and take 1 damage per round.

Creatures with multiple legs get -4 to their Save.

**68. Move Enchantment**

**R**: touch **T**: objects **D**: permanent

You touch an enchanted object with one hand and a ritually prepared object with your other hand. Save, with a +2 bonus for each [dice] invested in this spell. If you succeed, the enchantment moves to the new object. If you fail, the enchantment vanishes forever. You take a -2 penalty to the Save for each [dice] the caster invested in the original enchantment, and a -2 penalty if the target item and the original item are significantly different. It's not easy to move the enchantment for a sword into a ring, but you could probably move an enchantment from a ring to a crown without too much trouble.

**69. Mangling Blows**

**R**: 100' **T**: creature **D**: 0

Invisible hammers of force strike from every direction. Target creature takes [sum] bludgeoning damage, Save for half, and is pushed [dice]x5' in a random direction. 

**70. Conflicting Command**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature that can hear and understand you **D**: 0

You shout a magic phrase to your target. To you, and to anyone else, it is incomprehensible but your target interprets it as a magical command that is impossible to fulfill. "Fall down and jump up at the same time" is a possible translation, but the conflict is more fundamental. The target takes [sum]+ their Intelligence bonus damage and is stunned for [dice] rounds. Save negates.

**71. Paralyze Bird**

**R**: 200' **T**: creature with feathered wings **D**: [sum] rounds

Target creature must Save or be paralyzed for the spell's duration. They may make a new Save at the start of each round.

Gold you target becomes liquid and flows like thick soup. It is cold to the touch. Alloyed metals are also carried with the gold, though they may appear as streaks or bubbles in the liquid. The gold reforms into its original shape when the spell ends.

**73. Butterfly Hurricane**

**R**: 30’ radius **T**: self **D**: [sum] rounds

You create a whirling, brightly coloured mass of butterflies that cloaks you completely. Any ranged attacks fired into our out of the hurricane automatically miss.

Creatures other than the caster who end their turn inside the hurricane must Save or be befuddled for 1 round.

**74. Paper Automaton**

**R**: touch **T**: paper **D**: [sum] hours

You enchant a piece of plant-based paper or parchment to obey your commands. The paper folds into a tiny humanoid shape and follows simple instructions. It can lift nothing heavier than a single coin, but it can write and read. It has [dice] HP and Defense 10, but takes no damage from bludgeoning weapons. The size of the automaton depends on the dice you invest in the spell. 1 [dice]: mouse 2 [dice]: dog, 3 [dice]: person, 4 [dice], elephant. 

**75. Violently Depilate **

**R**: 50' **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: permanent

Target creature's hair flees it's body in a sudden, painful burst. The target is stunned for 1 round and takes 1d6 damage. Save negates. Creatures that prize their hair, such as Orthodox Wizards or Elves, may need to make a Save vs Fear or a Morale check. The target's hair will regrow at the normal rate. This spell has no effect on hairless creatures or creatures immune to pain.

**76. Sturdy Circle in the Air**

**R**: 100' **T**: point **D**: [sum] minutes

**78. Wellingbert's Obsessive Expertise**

**R**: touch **T**: self **D**: [sum] minutes

Name a Skill. Save, with a +2 bonus for each [dice] you invest past the first. If you fail, take [dice]+1d6 psychic damage. If you succeed, gain the chosen Skill with a rating of 8 for the spell's duration. You cannot learn things that would not be contained in a well-stocked library, or skills that are so rare only a few people could teach them to you. 

**79. Mirror Item**

**R**: touch **T**: object **D**: varies

You touch a non-magical object you could carry without assistance. The object is mirrored along one axis. Left becomes right. All details are otherwise preserved. The spell lasts for 1 [dice]: minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: days, 4 [dice] months, or permanent.

**80. Lock Joints**

**R**: 100' **T**: [dice]x2 creatures or objects **D**: [dice] rounds

Creatures or objects you target must Save or have their joints locked at their current angle and position for [dice] rounds. This could affect the hinges of a door, the links in a chain, or the legs of a sprinting horse. Stumbling creatures usually take 1d6 damage.

**81. Suspend Objects**

**R**: touch **T**: [sum] objects **D**: concentration or 1 minute

Objects that weigh no more than [dice] lbs are suspended in the air. The slightest effort knocks them to the ground. You do not need to see the suspended objects, but you do need to maintain concentration to keep them afloat. If you break concentration, the objects fall in up to one minute.

**82. Hone**

**R**: touch **T**: object **D**: permanent

You run your hands over a metal or wooden edge and hone it. The object becomes razor sharp. Blunt objects deal 1d6 damage. Weapons deal an extra 1d6 damage for the next [dice]x2 hits. The edge must be smaller than your outstretched arms.

**R**: 100' **T**: creature of [dice]x2 HD or less **D**: [sum] varies

A blinking globe of light flies from your hand and sink's into the target's head. The target must Save or become befuddled for the spell's duration. The target may attempt a new save at the end of each duration interval. 1 [dice]: rounds, 2 [dice]: minutes, 3 [dice]: hours, 4 [dice] days. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, the target also loses 1d6 Intelligence, to a minimum of 1, for the duration of the spell.

**84. Ultralucent Paint**

**R**: 50' **T**: creature or object **D**: [sum] hours

You splatter the target in bright octarine paint, leaving a mark the size of an apple. The mark is visible through fog, smoke, or total darkness, at any distance up to [dice] miles. It is also visible through solid barriers, such as stone walls, up to 10' thick. The paint drips off and marks the ground below the target. Unless bandaged or swabbed, the paint will leave a faint trail behind the target.

**85. Lavin's Pathclearing Servant**

**R**: [dice]x100' **T**: area **D**: 0

You send an invisible blade of force along a clearly defined path. Any light debris on the path (snow, small stones, leaves, grass) is pushed to the side. Any pressure plates or tripwires are activated. You do not have to be able to see the entire path, but you do need to know the approximate route the blade will take. The path is [dice]x10' wide. If you cast this spell with 3 [dice] or more, the range becomes [sum]x100'.

**86. Battering Beam**

**R**: 100' **T**: creature or object **D**: concentration.

A beam of force strikes a target you can see, pushing them backwards. Target must win an opposed Strength test against the beam or be pushed away from you 10' per round. Very large creatures only move 5' per round. The effective Strength of the beam depends on the dice invested. 1 [die]: 14, 2 [dice]: 16, 3[dice]: 18, 4 [dice] 20. If the target is an object, treat it as being struck by a blow of equivalent Strength each round. Each round you maintain concentration adds +1 to the Strength of this spell, to a maximum of 22 Strength. If the target cannot move backwards, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per round.

**87. Circle of Noise**

**R**: 100' **T**: area **D**: [sum] rounds

A circle of crackling white light 20' in radius appears at a point you designate. Creatures inside the circle must Save or be deafened for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, they are permanently deafened. Creatures inside the circle cannot hear anything outside the circle, and creatures outside the circle cannot hear anything inside the circle.

**88. Ulrich's Forceful Sigil**

**R**: touch, 50' **T**: object **D**: [sum] rounds

A writhing arcane symbol appears on an object you touch. Any creature within 100' of the sigil who looks at it must Save or be pushed back 5' and knocked prone. The symbol vanishes after [sum] rounds. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, you can instead set the duration of this spell to permanent, provided no one looks at the sigil. Once it is seen, the duration becomes to [sum] round as usual. 

**89. The Automatic Marching Mule**

**R**: touch **T**: point **D**: [sum] hours

You create a mule-like creature out of pure force. The creature has two bucket-like saddlebags on each side. It walks forward at a brisk trot. It will stop and turn at your verbal command, but you cannot make it reverse or slow down. You can only give it the commands "go", "stop", "turn left", and "turn right". The mule can carry twice as much as an ox. It has [dice]x2 HP, and any attacks automatically hit it. It is completely mindless and extremely literal. The mule will obey your last command until the spell's duration expires.

**90. Shrikeblast**

**R**: [dice]x10' cone **T**: area **D**: 0

Howling shards of raw magical power fly from your body. The shards lacerate anything in their path, dealing [sum] piercing damage, Save for half.

A suspended creature is capable of bearing up to its own body weight in additional pressure before falling. 

**91. Sympathetic Resonance**

**R**: touch **T**: two creatures or objects **D**: [sum] minutes

You touch one creature or object and then touch another creature or object. For the duration of this spell, any spells that affect one target will have their effects applied to the other target as well. Both targets must be valid, but range and line of sight between the targets is not considered. For example, you might touch a goblin and a dragon. If you strike the goblin with a magic missile, the dragon would be hit as well, for the same damage, even if the dragon was several hundred feet away and inside a cave.

**92. Cacophony**

**R**: 100' **T**: point **D**: [sum] hours

You send a small orb of force to a point you designate. The spell creates an incredibly loud clattering, wailing, and whistling when it detonates. Creatures within [sum]x5' must Save or be stunned for one round. It is audible in clear air up to a mile away. You can designate [dice] conditions under which the orb will detonate. You could say "now", "if anyone steps on it" or "if water touches it". The conditions must be obvious and must occur within 5' of the orb. When the spell's duration expires, you can choose to have the orb detonate or vanish silently. The orb is solid, and can be moved or thrown.

**93. Alberecht's Unreliable Disintegrator**

**R**: 100' **T**: object creature of [dice]x2 HD or less **D**: 0

Target creature, or an object weighing less than [dice]x200lbs, disintegrates into nothingness. Save +4 negates. Magical objects gain an additional +2 to their save. You can disintegrate a section of an object or creature but not very precisely.

**94. Squelch**

**R**: [dice]x10' **T**: spell **D**: 0

You can cast this spell as a reaction. You halve the duration, effects, and/or damage of a spell that would affect you or anything within [dice]x10' of you. You cannot affect the spell's range or area. If the spell requires a Save, you may instead have any affected targets gain +4 to their Save. The [sum] of this spell must equal or beat the [dice]x2 invested in the spell you are attempting to squelch. 

**95. Everland's Perfectly Reproduceable Test**

**R**: touch **T**: two creatures or objects **D**: [sum] minutes

You designate two targets. One target acts as the test subject. Any effects applied to the test subject will be, if conditions are identical, applied to the other target. For example, if you give a potion to one target creature, an identical potion given to the other target creature will have precisely identical effects. The two targets must be reasonably similar. You could not compare a stone to a mouse, but you could compare a mouse to a man. If you invest 2 [dice], the effect lasts for [sum] days. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, the effect is permanent. If you invest 4 [dice] or more, you may test more esoteric effects, such as philosophical arguments, love, or fear. 

**96. Sonorous Seeker**

**R**: [dice]x1 mile **T**: object **D**: [sum] hours

You create a fluttering star of light that twitters like a bird. Name a unique object you have clearly seen before, and, if the object is within the spell's range, the seeker will fly to it at the speed of an arrow and hover near it, chiming as loud as a bell. The seeker has 1 HP and a Defense of 16. If the object is not within the spell's range, the spell has a 50% chance of seeking out a similar object. Otherwise, it fails.

**97. Dredge**

**R**: 100' **T**: area **D**: 0

Buried or covered objects rise to the surface in area you designate, [dice]x10' in radius. If you cast this spell on the ground, coins, stones, and root will be pulled to the surface. If you cast it on water, sunken objects will rise to the surface and remain there as long as you maintain concentration. The total weight of dredged objects cannot exceed [dice]x100lbs. If you cast this spell targeting creatures in the area instead, the creatures must Save or be stunned for 1 round. If [sum] is greater than 12, they also take 1d6 damage and are knocked prone. Instead of targeting area, you can instead target a single sentient creature. The creature must Save (if unwilling) or recall a memory in perfect detail. You designate the memory ("the first time you met your wife", "where you buried the treasure".) The creature will be lost in a reverie for [sum] rounds. This reverie ends if the creature is attacked, threatened, or has to perform any action. This memory may induce a Fear or Morale test. It must be specific. "The scariest thing you have ever seen" would not work, but "the night your village burned" would.

**98. Rolling Spark**

**R**: 10' **T**: area **D**: [sum] rounds

A spark of lightning appears within 10' of you. Each round, it moves 5' straight ahead (you designate the original direction.) Creatures or objects in a 10' radius of the spark (so a 3x3 grid of 5' squares) take 2d6 lightning damage. Save negates. If the spark strikes a creature or object directly, or it is struck (Defense 12), the spark will bounce in a random direction. It may gain speed if struck with significant force. The spark floats 5' off the ground.

**99. Pyre**

**R**: 100' **T**: [sum] creatures or objects **D**: 0

Targets must Save vs Dex or catch on fire. Targets that are completely inflammable (soaked creatures, metal, etc.) do not need to Save. Targets that are very flammable (soaked in oil, dry wood) may not get a Save. You can target this spell precisely enough to light the wick of a single candle in a bundle, provided you can see the wick.

**100. Cascade of Power**

**R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: [dice]+1 rounds

During this spell's duration, any [dice] your target expends on other spells return to their pool on a 1-5, rather than a 1-3. When this spell's duration ends, you must Save or suffer a Mishap.

## Spider Wizards

Someone pointed out that putting one or two random words in front of "wizard" generates a class idea. Here's a "benefit spider wizard". If you thought my recent [GLOG](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/the-glog.html) [wizards ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-class-wizards.html)were too sensible then this is the class for you.
If you don't like spiders, *this is not the class for you.*
Spiders are reasonably clever. They need to plot hunting routes and ambush paths and anchor points for webs. Small spiders don't typically live long enough to learn anything else, but they never stop growing. A few become the size of cats, cagey and clever, as smart as a person. Some grow larger and larger. In Foreign Parts, or deep underground, there are tales of spiders are big as horses or fabled elephants.
The slightest magical contamination - a wizard's library, a spilled potion, a buried artifact - tips spiders from cunning into true intelligence and self-awareness. They learn to write. They collaborate and build structures. Larger spiders occupy the same niche as wolves. Some species are [pack hunters](http://falsemachine.blogspot.ca/2013/01/arachnopolis-rex.html.) Some, [the most feared](http://www.incunabuli.com/2018/01/wolf-spider.html), hunt alone. They prefer lowland forests with dense trees, few paths, and limited sunlight.

Spider wizards are outsiders. Their abilities are slightly more advanced and reputable than folk magic and midnight witchcraft, but not reputable enough to receive official acknowledgement. They learned their spells from spiders, carefully bribed with food and friendship. They are a rare and eccentric breed. 

### School: Spider Wizard

**Perk: **You are immune to spider venom. Spiderwebs refuse to stick to you.
**Drawback:** You must eat meat as a major component of any ration.
**Cantrips**

1. Perform a startling leap up to 20' horizontally or 10' vertically.
2. Touch a woven object to learn how long ago it was created. You may also receive impressions of its creator.

3. At will, you can remain perfectly motionless. You still need air, but you do not appear to breathe. You can remain like this for a number of hours equal to your Constitution.
     Spider Wizard perks are situational but convenient. The drawback is significant if you are from a herbivorous race; you probably can't become a Spider Wizard. The cantrips are fairly useful for exploration.

### Spider Wizard Spell List

You automatically get the "Speak with Spiders" spell at level 1. Roll for  your other spell normally.

**1. Speak with Spiders**
**R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [dice] minutes 
You can talk to spiders and they can talk back. Small spiders know about water, wind, and bugs. Larger spiders know about people and may even be able to tell them apart. Really large spiders, the dangerous ones, know all sorts of things. Spiders will generally treat people who can speak to them with cautious respect. 

**2. Hold Person**
**R**: 50' **T**: creature **D**: concentration, up to [sum] rounds
Target creature is locked in place. You must maintain concentration for this spell to work. Target can breathe and move their eyes, but cannot swim, fly, or perform any other action. If the creature is particularly willful, blasphemous, or a spellcaster, it may Save each round to break free, with a penalty equal to the [dice] you invested.

**3. Featherfall**
**R**: 10’ **T**: [dice] creatures or objects **D**: 0 
If you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction to negate it. You float gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly late.) 

**4. Entangling Web**

R; 50' **T**: area **D**: 0

At a point you designate, a [dice]x10' radius sphere of web bursts into existence. Anything in the web moves at half speed and takes a -4 penalty to Attack and Defense.

5. Spontaneous Generation

R. touch **T**: object **D**: 0

You hand another creature a nonmagical object. They must willingly take it from you. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]: pebble-sized, 2 [dice]: grape-sized, 3 [dice]: bucket or helmet-sized, 4 [dice]: person-sized. Up to [sum] rounds later, at a time you chose, the object permanently turns into spiders (or one big spider.) The spiders aren't hostile or venomous, but their bites itch and they probably don't want to be held.

6. Gift of Silk

**R**: touch **T**: point **D**: [sum] hours
A rope [dice]x50' long appears where you designate. You can choose to have one end anchored securely to a solid surface. The rope is very strong and slightly sticky.
**7. Gift of Fangs**

**R**: touch **T**: [dice] weapons **D**: 1 hour
Weapons you touch become venomous, dealing an additional 1d4 damage on a hit.

8. Spiderclimb

**R**: touch **T**: [dice] creatures **D**: [sum] minutes

Targets can climb or walk up any solid surface as well as a spider could, even upside-down. Crumbling surfaces, liquids, or jumping will break the spell.

9. Poisoned Words

**R**: 50' **T**: creature of [sum] HD or less **D**: 0
Target creature vomits up 2d10 litres of spiders. The spiders aren't hostile or venomous, but their bites itch and they probably don't want to be held. This spell does not deal any damage, but it may require a Morale check.
**10. Widower's Friend**
**R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [dice] hours
You summon a tiny black spider with yellow markings. Its venom requires creatures of 4 HD or less to Save or Die. You can name and describe one target. The spider will try to find the target and bite them within the duration of the spell. After that, it still exists, but it forgets who it needs to hunt. You can remind it by speaking to it. The spider has 1 HP and moves at normal speed.

### Emblem Spells

**11. Spiderform**
**R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [sum] hours
You transform into a spider the size of a pebble. You can fit through a keyhole. You have 1 HP and Defense 16 (as Plate.)  If you are reduced to 0 HP, you die.  You move at normal speed, but you can climb as a spider, descend on a silk thread, and do other plausible spider things. You can cast spells you have memorized, but you cannot use any gear. You are not venomous unless you cast the *gift of fangs* spell. Your venom then deals 1d4 damage. You can see 30' in all light conditions.

**12. Trapdoor Monster**
**R**: 50' **T**: point **D**: varies.
A gigantic trapdoor spider appears beneath a solid surface within 10' of a point you designate. The exact position of the perfectly camouflaged trap door isn't know to you or anyone else. The spider will attack the nearest creature smaller than it or of approximately equal size. It owes you nothing and is not friendly. The size, HD, and damage of the spider depends on the [sum] rolle**D**:
1-7: person-sized, 2 HD, 2d6 damage
8-12: ogre-sized, 4 HD, 3d6 damage
>12: cottage-sized, 6 HD, 4d6 damage

Creatures reduced to 0 HP are dragged into the spider's lair. If you invest 4 [dice], the spider is permanent, although it will spend 12 hours wrapping and eating its prey before attacking again. Otherwise, it vanishes after attacking one creature. 

### Mishaps

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
2. Take 1d6 damage 
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail. Mutations will be spider-based and disgusting.
4. Blind for 1d6 rounds 
5. Panic for 1d6 rounds
6. Vomit 2d10 litres of spiders.

### Doom

1. You transform into a spider (as *spiderform*) for one day.
2. You transform into a spider (as *spiderform*) for three days. Living creatures (other than spiders) find you exceptionally disgusting and will squish you if they can.
3. You transform into a spider (as *spiderform*) permanently. Each month you are a spider, you must Save or forget one year of your previous life. Living creatures (other than spiders) will go out of their way to squish or devour you.

This doom can be avoided by creating a work of textile art capable of moving an angel to tears, or by killing the Emperor of All Ravens.
EDIT: [Here's some good advice on using spiders in your games](http://wizzzargh.blogspot.ca/2017/12/make-spider-encounters-spidery.html.)

## White Hand Wizards

The White Hand [wizards ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-class-wizards.html)are a chartered order imported from Foreign Parts. Their order is not very numerous, but their feats are widely seen as legendary. They are seen as the kindest of all wizard schools, mostly due to propaganda efforts and the occasional feat in battle. They have a strong but blessedly academic rivalry with the Orthdox Wizards. The ant-lings famously produce many White Hand wizards with tattooed white circles on their foreheads.

They are notoriously pious, but in a judgemental and unsympathetic way. You always feel like you’re being disrespectful when a Wizard of the White Hand is around. They tend to donate to the Church and avoid obvious temptations. They prefer villages to isolated towers and polite respect to fawning adoration or cold contempt.

Some ideas stolen from [here](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2013/12/sister-witches-and-monastic-wizards.html.)

### School: Wizard of the White Hand

**Perk:** Any spell with a range of touch can be cast a target you have previously touched, up to 10 miles per Wizard template. You can only have one link at a time. 

**Drawback:** You cannot eat meat. You must wear a white circle, either on your robes or belt or otherwise marked visibly on your body.

### Cantrips

1. Press your hands together and count as Str 20 against being pushed, shoved, or moved. 
2. Spend 10 minutes running your hands over your clothes to remove any stains or dirt. 
3. If an attack would reduce you from full HP to 0 HP or less, you may spend all your remaining MD to survive it with 1 HP. You must spend at least 1 MD. 

The White Hand wizard cantrips are fairly useful. You can be an excellent anchor for a climbing team and you'll always be the best explorer dressed in a horrible damp cave. You also have a built-in method to survive early-game death.

Usually the corpse will talk using it's normal mouth, but it may also communicate the response in other ways. It's always understandable, although sometimes a bit cryptic.
**10. Black Hand **
**R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [sum] rounds 
One of your arms turns invisible. You get an illusory arm on the same side that you can control freely. Small objects, like a dagger, held in this arm become invisible. The arm can interact with ghosts, pass through walls, etc. 
**Emblem Spells**
**11. White Hand **
**R**: 0 **T**: self **D**: [sum] rounds 
One of your hands becomes as hard and durable as steel. It doesn't become any heavier and deals no extra damage, but it is completely impervious to damage. You can even use it to parry sword blows. It grants +1 to Defense. It can pick up anything, manipulate fire, stir acid, etc. 

**12. Vivigraphy **
**R**: touch **T**: creature **D**: 10 minutes
Touched living creature is compelled to answer [dice] questions. This is the flesh body answering, not the mind. The body will answer honestly, but flesh bodies technically see/hear/experience everything the living body does, but they only remember things that involve food, sex, pain, adrenaline responses, and stuff like that. Usually the body will talk using it's normal mouth, but it may also communicate the response in other ways, like spelling out answers in freckles. It's always understandable, although sometimes a bit cryptic. 
**Mechanical Notes on the White Hand Wizard Spell List **

These guys are Orthodox Wizards from a different land. Over there,* white hand* is as common as *fireball*. The spell list has a good mix of direct damage spells, utility spells, and some really bizarre ones. Unlike some other wizard schools, there aren't many spells that will actively get you into trouble, unless you decide to use your long-distance link and *inflict pain*, or some other unusual combination.

**Mishaps**

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours 
2. Take 1d6 damage 
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail. 
4. Blind for 1d6 rounds 
5. Deafened for 1d6 rounds 
6. Spell targets you (if harmful) or enemy (if beneficial) or fizzles (if neutral.) 

**Doom of the White Hand **

1. You fade from existence for a day, leaving only your shadow behind. 
2. You fade from existence for 3 days, leaving only your shadow behind. Your shadow roams without you. 
3. You permanently fade, leaving a ravenous shadow behind to plague the living. 

This doom can be avoided by avoiding total darkness for the rest of your life, or by traveling to the surface of the sun.

## Humble Art

You have spell dice equal to your WIS modifier, and these dice can only be used for casting spells of the Art. If you have at least 1 spell die, you know WIS - 10 spells. Learning new spells requires the tutelage of another individual. Spells of the Art cannot be written down or copied in spellbooks or scrolls.

Wizards do not use the Humble Art. Years of academia have blackened their opinion of it to such a degree that they would not consider using it except in a most desperate situation, and even then only after the rest of their magic has been spent.

Spells of the Humble Art can be improved if the correct sympathetic components are in place. Add +1 spell die when casting with the components listed below. Additional dice are burned out upon use and do not return.

### Spell Descriptions

#### Augury

**R**: touch  **T**: self  **D**: 0

In reading the entrails of sacrificed animals, you look for an omen of what is to come. You have a [dice] x 10% chance of successfully foreseeing a future event, plus [1 die] per hit die of sacrificed creature or hour spent cloud-watching.

Even if successful, omens will often have multiple potential meanings. 

#### Call Upon the Folk

**R**: 100'  **T**: Folk  **D**: 0

Roll under WIS. If successful, the local Folk will appear to you, and you gain [dice] to your reaction roll when conversing with them.

- [sum] > 15
- The Folk's true name is known (automatic)

#### Contact Other Plane

**R**: 100' **T**: extraplanar creature  **D**: 0

- If [sum] > 15, you can contact a specified being on a specified plane.

Gain +1 [dice] by consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms. Automatic success with the true name of an extraplanar being.

[sum]x5 / see below **T**: Object or creature **D**: concentration / 0

Detec**T**: The caster can tell if the target is passing within range

If you have a piece of what you are trying to locate, you will be able to know its exact location at the time of casting.

#### Exorcism

**R**: 20' **T**: spirit possessing object or creature **D**: 0

Cast out an evil spirit of [dice] HD or lower from an object or creature. This will not destroy the spirit, just remove it from its host.

Gain +1[dice] from holy water or other objects / substances anathema to the spirit

Gain +2[dice] if you know the spirit's true name 

#### Identify

**R**: 20' **T**: Object or creature **D**: 0

Effect depends on the [dice] invested.

- 1**D**: Caster can determine if something has been changed by magic, and the potency of the enchantment. Mundane properties and names are revealed (ex: "this is phosphorus, it can burn underwater."
- 2**D**: Caster can determine the above, as well as what kind of magic was used, when it was enchanted, and the effect of the enchantment. Advanced mundane properties are revealed (ex:
- 3**D**: Caster can determine the above, as well as who created the enchantment
- 3D + physical piece of targe**T**: Learn the true name of the target or of the original caster.

#### Hunter's Mark

**R**: sight **T**: creature **D**: permanent

Marked target takes [dice] extra damage from all of your attacks, and you are aware of its general location within [sum] miles.

#### Magic Circle

**R**: [sum] **T**: spirit **D**: until broken

A circle is marked out on the ground which may hold and bind a spirit of [dice] HD or less. The Folk will consider this a grave insult.

Gain +1 [dice] if the circle is made with salt, iron flakes, or other substances the spirit does not like.

Gain +2 [dice] if the circle is inscribed with the target's true name.

#### Mending

**R**: touch **T**: object **D**: 0

An object weighing [sum] pounds or less, made of stone, clay, wood, or fiber, can be repaired. Mending metal in this manner requires 2 [dice]. Using this spell a second time on the same object carries a 1-in-6 chance of breaking the object completely, increasing by 1 each time it is mended.

#### Purify Food and Water

**R**: touch **T**: food or water **D**: 0

You can clean and prepare [sum] tainted rations. Roll a second d6: on a 1, the removed toxins become a rotball sprite. (0 HD, 1 HP, AC as unarmored, 1 damage, save vs poison or 1d6 CON damage until cured)

#### Skywrite

 **R**: 1 mile **T**: clouds **D**: [sum] x 30 seconds

You can shape or create [sum] cloud-glyphs, which last for [dice] hours. Each glyph will be a simple word or idea: one cannot make the statement "Help! We are under siege by orcs!" but "Help (needed) / orcs / danger" is a viable message.

#### Spare the Dying

**R**: Touch **T**: Creature **D**: [dice] hours

The target, upon hitting death's door, can cling to life for [dice] hours, so long as they are not injured again. The caster must save against poison each hour or take 1d6 damage from shouldering the target's pain. 

#### Speak with Dead 

**R**: touch **T**: corpse or other remains **D**: 10 minutes

You can communicate with lingering spirits that have died within the las**T**: 

- 1**D**: day
- 2**D**: month
- 3**D**: year  

To call up spirits older than a year, the caster must know the language of the dead and invoke 3 [dice]. 

Ghosts are imprints of an individual, and so do not possess all of that person's knowledge, nor are they able to provide incredibly specific information unless it was incredibly important to the target.

#### Woman's Work

**R**: n/a **T**: n/a **D**: n/a

With the proper equipment (material components, a cooking pot, water), you can make [sum] doses of contraceptive, proconceptive, or contramenstrual. These are universally-accepted trade goods, and can be redeemed for favors, mundane items, and information. This spell can also be invoked for the safe delivery of an infant.

### Special Spells

#### Control Weather

**R**: local region **T**: environment **D**: 6 hours+

The ritual has a base [sum]% chance of success, but there is no limit to the amount of people (and their dice) that can be added. Attempting to change the weather to something unseasonable or unnatural (ex: snow in summer, rain of frogs) halves the percentage of success.

Roll +1 [dice] for every two hours beyond the six required.

#### Coming of Age

**R**: touch **T**: adolescent **D**: permanent

The boy stands before his father and the elders of the community.  The girl, having bled to the first time, is taken by her mother to the local wise woman. They must go out and accomplish a task: hunt a beast, make a pilgrimage to a holy site, outwit their elders, prove their bravery, perform a rite before the community, solve a seemingly-impossible task, learn of a great secret, accomplish some act in the community's benefit, or so on.

Upon completion, the target gains 1 level. They are now permitted to marry, and will be welcomed as an adult of the community with all responsibilities that entails. (Translation: You take 2 extra convictions and must pay 50% of your earnings back to the community.) In some regions, couples engaged to be wed are assigned the same task, and must complete it together.

Failure through cowardice or other personal weakness creates an evil spirit, which will haunt the individual and prevent them from gaining XP until they succeed at the task, or defeat the spirit. 

#### Passing the Torch

**R**: touch **T**: person: **D**: permanent

A character of level 7 or higher bequeaths some or all of their [dice] to another individual.  This does not compound across generations (ex: A has a +2, and gives it to B, who has +1. B now has +3, but would only be able to pass on +1 to C.)

## Class: Summoner

 ---------------------------------------- |
| Lost Crystal, [Jakub Rebelka](https://www.artstation.com/artist/shz) |

**Starting Equipment: **robes, dagger
**Starting Skill: [d3]:** 1. Cultist, 2. Religion, 3. History
**A: **+1 SD, +1 Summon Slot, +2 Entities, Summoning

**B:** +1 SD, +1 Summon Slot, +2 Entities, Powerful Hold

**C:** +1 SD, +1 Summon Slot +2 Entities, Soul Vision

****D**:** +1 SD, +1 Summon Slot, Master Summoner

You gain +1 Summoning Die and +1 Summon Slot for each Summoner template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each.

### Summoning

Summon an Entity by rolling your Summoning Dice. Dice return to your pool and can be used again on a 1-3, but are exhausted for the day on a 4-6. On doubles, a Mishap occurs. On triples, a Doom occurs. You can only summon an Entity once per day, and you can only control a number of entities equal to your Summon Slots at the same time. You can summon an entity for [sum] hours before it vanishes. It takes one round to summon an Entity. You must be able to speak and you cannot be distracted.

Summoned entities sometimes have strange minds.

You require its true name and knowledge of relevant rituals. Seek ancient scrolls and esoteric religious knowledge to discover summonable entities. Unlike Wizard spells, the information does not destroy the media it is written on once it is learned. Summoners guard their knowledge jealously to avoid sharing power. 

**Powerful Hold**

Chose one entity you know how to summon. Instead of [sum] hours, the entity is summoned for [sum]x2 hours. Whenever you gain a level, you may change which entity this ability applies to. 

**Soul Vision**

You can see the souls of living creatures. This allows you to guess the approximate location of invisible creatures. You can also immediately tell if a person is possessed, undead, or a spellcaster. The price for this gift is your connection to others. You permanently lose 1d6 Wisdom (as the constant scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or 1d6 Charisma (as you become callous and jaded.)

**Master Summoner**

Roll for 6 additional Entities.

Alternatively, name an Entity you already control. For as long as you live, the Entity that you name will always remain with you. You do not need to roll to summon it. It still occupies a Summon Slot.

### Mishaps

1. Summon Dice only return to your pool on a 1-2 for the next 24hrs

2. Take 1d6 damage

3. Mute and Blind 1d6 rounds

4. Agony 1d6 rounds

5. Summon has a 1-in-6 chance of vanishing each hour after being summoned

6. Summon is not under your control. Will pursue its own agenda for the duration of the summon. May take on a different form.

### Dooms

1. Vanish for 1d6 hours to a strange world of blinding light and geometric shapes made of clay. Perform strange acts under the light of a thousand stars. 

2. Vanish for 3d6 hours, as above. Return with 0 HP.

3. Vanish permanently.

### Entities

Entities have 10 Attack, 10 Defense, and 10 HP unless otherwise noted. They automatically Save against magic and magic-like effects unless the caster knows their true name, in which case they automatically fail. If an Entity is reduced to 0 HP it vanishes, but it takes no permanent harm. 

The names listed are not their true names. Their true names are very difficult to write and pronounce.

1. Melchior, of Eyes Unblinded

Enters from somewhere not observed by the caster. Appears as a withered old man in fine robes, or a beautiful young woman with no hair. In either form, Melchior will mutter constantly, repeating meaningless phrases or snippets of conversation. As long as Melchior can see the tongue of a creature, it can tell if the creature is lying. It will hiss and lunge at anyone who lies for purely selfish reasons, and will seek to remove their tongue. Melchior will carry items for you and will provide banal and useless advice if asked. Believed to be one of the most powerful Entities. Has 10 Defense and 10 HP unless it wants to have more. 

2. Cantopas, the Grey Mirage

Enters and moves like smoke. Appears as a rippling cloud of grey-white fabric. Sheds light like a candle. An object smaller than an apple given to Cantopas will vanish. Cantopas moves as quickly as an arrow (150 miles per hour), and will bring the object to the location or person you designate, provided it can reach them before vanishing. If it cannot, it will try and drop the item somewhere along the quickest path. If Cantopas descends onto the head of a living creature, the creature must Save or be deafened and blinded for 1 round. Cantopas has 1 HP.

3. Thoriel, who Demands Reverence

Enters with a thunderclap. Appears as two rotating rings of white light, one inside the other, tumbling through the air. The size of a clenched fist. Shakes, as if enraged. Speaks in high-pitched monotone. Up to [dice] times per summon, can demand a single creature it can see "PRAY". The creature must make the sign of the Authority or, the next round, by struck by a 4d6 lightning bolt. Animals of Creation will kneel or bow instead. Can sense the presence of those who have consciously rejected the Church within 100', but cannot sense mindless creatures, undead, or those who were never converted.

4. Rone, the Blade of Love

Enters silently and appears in your hand. A black dagger of stone and grey leather. Cannot speak or see, but can hear very, very well. Creatures injured by Rone feel no pain, only a curious sensation of pressure. If you hold it like a pen and use blood as ink, Rone will write the answers to any questions you ask, provided it has overheard the answers since you summoned it. It could transcribe a conversation in perfect detail or tell you how many people entered a room, what they said, and when they left. If anyone holds Rone against the caster's will, they must Save or take 1d6 damage, and Rone vanishes. If anyone holds Rone with the caster's permission, they must Save. If they fail, each morning they must Save against the desire to hold Rone again.

5. Gornim, Lord of Vermin

Enters on a cloud of flies and biting insects. Appears as statue of a child made of clay. Crude. Gluttonous. Can command vermin to move, assemble, or bring tribute (food.) Any other requests are met with suspicion and peevish demands. If provided with sufficient food (a larder or storeroom), Gormin will call all vermin within [dice] miles to him for a grand feast. 

6. Malrane, the Scholar's Aide

Enters from somewhere not observed by the caster. Appears as a thin, tired young man or woman with wiry hair. Can speak and translate any language, living or dead. Will not speak or translate blasphemies, or prayers to any god but the Authority. Can only offer a literal translation unless reading by the light of the noonday sun, in which case, a full allegorical and contextual translation is prepared. Cannot, or refuses to, write. 

7. Esilan, the Keeper of Hours

Enters in a shower of feathers. Appears as a floating hourglass orbited by wings. Can accurately and precisely measure any time interval it sees. Up to [dice] times per summon, can demand a single creature it can see "AGE". Target creature's age mirrors for [sum] rounds. A 20-year-old creature becomes 2 years old. A 92-year-old creature becomes 29. A 106 year old dragon becomes 601. This cannot directly cause a creature to die or suffer any damage, but it may affect HP or stats. If confronted by blasphemies, glows as bright as a torch.

8. Simpulex, Carnal Bookkeeper

Enters from just behind the caster. Appears as an androgynous humanoid wrapped in a silk ribbon. Is extremely beautiful. If Simpulex touches a creature, it learns the creature's entire sexual history in graphic detail. Will attempt to seduce a suitable target it if not directly observed by the summoner. Uses poetry and flattery. If the target willingly kisses Simpulex, both the target and Simpulex vanish. The target never returns.

9. Bantos, Life-Leech

Enters by squirming up from cracks in the ground. Appears as a smiling man who vaguely resembles the summoner. Creatures touched by Bantos take 1d4 damage per round. Bantos heals 1d4 HP per round. Bantos has a Strength of 16 and does not need to breathe.

10. Hisbic, the Coin Counter

Enters in a puff of greasy smoke. Appears as a squashed and twisted humanoid, with a huge mouth and gut, no neck or eyes, and tiny limbs. Floats and tumbles through the air like a leaf. Will devour any coins given to it. Will regurgitate the coins at the summoner's request, at any point, even if summoned years later. Loves the taste of rare or unusual coins. Will only swallow metal coins, not jewelry, shells, or promissory notes. Can accurately guess the amount of currency a person is carrying at any given time. Can convert 10 gp per hour from one currency to another, in any format. Loathes counterfeiters. 

11. Raspalan, the Urgent Guide

Enters by running in via a door or window. Appears as a thin human with a scraggly beard and no clothes other than sandals. Cannot stop running. Will lead the summoner to any destination they name, provided it can be reached by running at a breakneck pace and leaping over obstacles. Will attempt to warn the summoner of traps, monsters, jumps, spikes, and other hazards in time to allow a Save. If the summoner does not follow or falls behind, Raspalan will still run to the destination and then vanish when not observed. If trapped, manacled, or cornered, will come up with some means of escape that may also benefit the summoner. Cannot be persuaded to run into a battle, but often runs through them accidentally.

12. Gemwick, Spell Tutor

Enters in a shower of sparks. Appears as a red humanoid the size of an acorn. Has a wizard's robe, hat, and staff. If a wizard sacrifices a limb or eye (of their choice), Gemwick will either teach them a new spell or improve (mutate) a spell they already know. Is respectful, but slightly bored of the summoner. Once per day, can summon 1d6 Limb Homonculi (as Apes, with 1HP), which are made from the fused limbs and eyes of wizards he has assisted in the past. The homunculi obey only Gemwick. Gemwick desires magical items, spells, and the shapely limbs of wizards.

13. Banzatoul, the Morphing Chain

Enters with a musical clatter. Appears as a floating ring of chain the size of a barrel, spinning slowly. If a living creature passes through the centre of the chain, it is temporarily randomized. Roll for a random gender, appearance, and new stats (3d6 in order.) The creature's species does not change. A creature can only be changed once per day. When Banzatoul vanishes, the effects end. Arrows fired through Banzatoul have a 50% chance to catch on fire. Spells with an elemental damage type that pass completely through Banzatoul on the way to their target have a 50% chance of changing elemental damage types.

14. Quen, the Truculent Goat

Enters with a clatter of hooves. Appears as a six-legged grey goat. Has an Attack and Defense of 14. Loves to charge things. If Quen charges and hits an enemy of 2 HD or less, the enemy is automatically knocked prone. Any gate or door less than 20' tall or wide and not protected by magic that is charged and hit by Quen bursts open. Quen prefers to charge targets taller than it, targets with horns, or targets that look cheerful. If no targets are designated by the summoner, it has a 50% chance of charging a random target each hour. 

15. Fizby, Friend of the Stars

Enters with a faint hiss and crackle. Appears as a tiny blue sphere the size of a berry. Glows as brightly as a candle. Will move as you direct and follow people or objects. Each hour it is summoned, there is a 10% chance a falling star fragment will strike Fizby, or the area directly above Fizby if not exposed to the sky. Roll 1d6+[dice] for the type of stone summoned. 1. Tiny fragment of cold stone (no damage.) 2-5. Minor stone fragment, 2d6 bludgeoning damage. 6. Minor iron fragment. 2d6 damage but worth [damage]x5gp to wizards or blacksmiths. 7-8. Major stone fragment. 4d6 bludgeoning damage, target must Save or be knocked prone. 9. Major iron fragment. 4d6 damage, 

target must Save or be knocked prone, worth [damage]x5gp to wizards or blacksmiths. 10. Star Core. Everything in a 1 mile radius takes 6d6 fire damage. Everything in a 100' radius is obliterated. The star core is the size of a fist and burns for 2d10 days while slowly evaporating into nothingness. 
16. Doron, the Shield of the Righteous

Enters with a small thunderclap. Appears as a round shield of brass engraved with tightly packed combatants. Can be carried by anyone as a shield (+1 Defense.) If you "sunder" the shield (reducing incoming damage by 1d12), Doron does not break, but instead reveals one of your sins or failings to all present in a disgusted tone. It will present your sins in the least charitable way possible. If you are attacked by an agent of the Authority (a paladin, an angel, etc.), Doron will still defend you but will reveal one sin every round.
17. Astokepolos, Diagnosticator

Enters in a stream of leaves and smoke. Appears as a gnarled walking stick with a serpent wrapped around it. Astokepolos can diagnose one illness per day, no matter how obscure or complex, and offer a cure. Roll 1d6+[dice]. 1. Cure is impossible (decapitation), 2-4. Cure is difficult but possible (the blood of an albino donkey, the tears of a virtuous raven, a stone from a lost temple), 5-6. Cure is possible to achieve shortly (a rare local plant, a particular ritual), 7-8. Cure is trivial (a common plant, a short ritual chant), 9. Cure is instant (a pressure point, a single word), 10. Cure is instant but the target will die in 1d6 days, target is not offered a choice. Any creatures cured with Astokepolos's advice owe their souls, or a portion of them, to him, and he will claim them at death unless prevented. He bears no ill will if prevented provided it is done politely. Astokepolos can also speak to and translate for serpents.

18. Orniel, the Ash Knight

Enters in a cloud of ash. Appears as a suit of charred plate armour, stacked neatly on the ground. Any humanoid who puts on the helmet will be compelled (Save once to immediately remove the helmet) to put on the rest of the armour. If they succeed, they immediately immolate, and the Ash Knight is created. The Ash Knight has Attack 14, Defense 16, and the HP of the person inside the armour. It wields a sword made of smoke and cinders (d8+2 damage, cannot be parried or blocked by shields.) The creature inside the armour can be faintly heard screaming as they burn to death. The Ash Knight loses 1 HP per hour, and disappears when the summon ends. It does not speak, but will obey most commands without hesitation.

19. Weeblen, Blade Tamer

Enters from somewhere not observed by the caster. Appears as a portly man with grey eyes and slightly stained traveling clothes. Can sharpen any blade. Up to [sum] times per summon, can (a) create a sword, dagger, arrow, or axe that lasts for the duration of the summon or one day, whichever is less (b) sharpen a weapon to give it +1 slashing damage until the end of a combat, (c) identify who forged a blade and when or (d) identify when a blade was last used. Weeblen will not fight, but will assist with mundane tasks if given ale or rations.

20. Creston, who Adjudicates

Enters by floating down from above. Appears as a floating stone sphere the size of a cabbage, carved to resemble a stylized human head. Speaks in a booming tone. If two objects, items, values, or issues are presented to Creston, along with a criteria, Creston will judge them. For example, you could ask "Which of these gems is most valuable?", "Which of my friends is most cowardly?" or "Which of these two wines would I enjoy most?" Creston cannot answer questions that are not local and immediate. It cannot answer "Which country will win the war?" or "Which hallway did the King run down?". Creston enjoys finely made handicrafts and loathes cheats and pretenders.

21. Jalpirtan, the First Assassin

Enters from the shadows. A thin woman in black and grey, beautiful, but cold. Speaks in whispers. Once per day, Jalpartian can kill a single mortal target you name, provided you have a piece of the target's hair or flesh, and the target can be reached within the duration of the summon. Jalpirtan will demand an equal sacrifice: a lord for a lord, a peasant for a peasant, or the equivalent value in lives, calculated by some obscure process. Alternatively, she can offer advice in the arts of poison-making, stealth, burglary, and knife-fighting. If the advice is simple and the conversation is pleasant, she may not demand a price, but she might demand the summoner test their new-found knowledge on an arbitrary target. If the summoner provides her with a suitable apprentice (a child under 10 with no living family, who has killed at least one person), Jalpirtan will take the apprentice and provide the summoner with a detailed plan to locate and kill one mortal target of the summoner's choice. 

22. Antrac, the Dark Flame

Enters in a flare of fire. Appears as a floating orb of dark red flame that emits no light. The orb is the size of a horse. Antrac can imitate any voice it has heard while summoned. It can shrink to the size of a marble. The flame causes no damage to living creatures or plants but otherwise burns as a normal fire. 

23. Louchan, the Scythe of Bones

Enters silently, in the caster's hand. Appears as a scythe of bones. Can be wielded with two hands (d6 slashing damage.) Any creatures reduced below 0 HP by the scythe have a 50% chance to crumble to dust and rise as skeletons of appropriate size and HD in 1d6 rounds. The skeletons last for the duration of the summon, and obey whoever holds Louchan. Both Louchan and the skeletons it creates instantly crumble to dust if exposed to sunlight. 

24. Sbendis, Helpful Vermin

Enters by burrowing from beneath the earth. Appears as a thin, flattened, asymetrical crustacean. Speaks in a whistling tone. If you boil and eat Sbendis (which she readily encourages), the delicious broth formed by her body can nourish up to 10 creatures for a day. If you consume her entire body without cooking it, you gain 10 temporary HP for the duration of the summon. Sbendis can burrow into the body of a creature that died no more than 1 minute ago and control its body for up to an hour. She is a very poor mimic and is nearly useless in combat.

25. Hypanian, the Land-Ship

Enters with a ruble of earth. Appears as a stone ship, crudely carved, with stone sails and a stone rudder. Can only be summoned above ground, in an area with solid ground. Will move at 2 miles per hour across land, cutting a furrow that folds behind it. Ignores trees, mountains, hills, elevation, and lava. Treats rivers and glaciers as reefs and islands. Ignores wind as well. Can carry up to 10 people or equivalent goods in moderate discomfort. Hypanian is intelligent and understands commands, but sometimes forgets to warn passengers of danger.

26. Goamloamer, the Warming Beast

Enters with a shuffle and a pop. Appears as a pig-like creature with no face. Gloamloamer is twice the size of a horse, moves as slowly as a person walking, and cannot attack. It has 20 HP, is always hit by melee attacks, and feels no pain. It is very warm. You cannot eat its flesh, but if you sleep next to it, you count as being inside a tent. If you place a healthy egg under the gloamloamer it will hatch in 1/100th the usual time (5hrs for a chicken's egg.) You can put up to 20 eggs under the Gloamloamer at once.

27. Lukian, the Eye of the Gatekeeper

Enters with a trumpet blast. Appears as a grey glass orb the size of a marble, flickering with faint shadows. Hovers and faintly chants hymns. No ghost or demon can willingly come within a 10' radius of Lukian. Any invisible ghosts or demons within 30' are fully revealed in their true form. Lukian can also tell false priests of the Authority from true ones. 

28. Xeriandel, Whose Form is Agony

Enters with a hideous shrieking noise. Appears as a pulsing rift of light the size of a clenched fist.Targets looking at Xeriandel must Save or take 1 damage per round. Even if they Save, targets develop a splitting headache. Xeriandel will always remain within 20' of the caster, passing through walls and barriers if needed. If not given instructions every 10 minutes, will slowly drift towards the summoner's line of sight. If the summoner fallsunconscious with Xeriandel nearby, Xeriandel will descend into the summoner's ear and reduce them to 0HP. 

29. Jentro, the Mirror of Life

Enters by stepping up from the summoner's shadow. Appears as an identical duplicate of summoner, save for some subtle detail, such as eye colour or a missing scar. Will act as directed for the spell's duration, with the caster's stats or 10, whichever is higher. Is intelligent enough to carry out very complex tasks, but has trouble improvising. Cannot deal damage or cast spells, but can appear to do so via illusions. The illusions are always minor and short-lived.

30. Kylon, Discord Manifest

Enters with a clatter of stones. Appears as a dusty stone idol the size of a brick. Up to [sum] times per summon, Kylon can cause two people to Save or disagree on topic they were discussing. The disagreement may be resolved, or it may turn to violence. If the dust from Kylon is rubbed into a book or letter, the text will change to contain veiled insults and contradictions for the duration of the summon. Kylon can hear and speak, butprefers to remain smug and silent.

31. Uziam, the Creeping Death

Enters as a black stain on a surface. The summoner has [sum] minutes to flee the area. After [sum] minutes, a white figure with tar-like hand and footprints will crawl from the stained surface. Uziam will stalk and strangle (Strength 14) any sentient living creatures in the area, starting with those closest to the summoning point. Serious opposition will cause Uziam to vanish and select a new target. Uziam can pass through walls andturn invisible if required. It only targets the fearful, the isolated, and the weak. Uziam cannot enter areas of direct sunlight, but it can extinguish non-magical flames at will, provided it is hunting a target. It will happily hunt and strangle the summoner.

32. Krentos, Knight of Leaves

Enters with a storm of dried leaves. Appears as ancient suit of animated plate armour with branches growing from the joints. The Knight of Leaveshas Attack 14, Defense 16, and HP equal to the hours of the day remaining until sunset (18 to 8, depending on the season.) At night, or if not exposed to sunlight in the past 2 hours, the Knight of Leaves is completely dormant. While active, it will attack any targets you designate. It does not speak. Dryads and tree-creatures will be polite to anyone in the company of the Knight of Leaves.

33*. Enti, Kite of Eyes

Enters with an accompanying host of winds. Appears as a tattered blue kite with painted eyes. In a good wind (not provided), Enti will rise up to 1,000 feet in the air over the course of the summon. While in the air, anyone holding the other end of Enti's kite string and spool will be able to see from Enti's eyes. You can use this ability at any time (to peek around corners or under doors, for example), but Enti is happiest while flying, andmay provide insight into the things it sees while in the air. Anyone holding Enti's string and spool can cast spells through its eyes.

34. Ophinania, Rot Butterfly

Enters with a cloud of stinking air. Appears as an ordinary yellow-grey butterfly. Is invulnerable to harm. Constantly produces an odour so foul thata) no one within 100' can eat unless starving b) food rots or spoils in 1/10th the usual time c) white fabric or paint becomes discoloured and d)creatures with a sense of smell must Save once to enter the area, and once again to enter within 10' of Ophinania. The summoner is immune tothe last effect, but allies are not. The last effect only applies if creatures are volunarily approaching Ophinania. Walking towards a creature does not require them to Save or flee. Ophinania can tell how long a body has been dead, a flower cut, bread left since baking, or any other duration related to rot and spoiling. She will examine up to [sum] items per summon.

35. Banalor, the Light of Creation

Enters with a shimmer of golden light. Appears as floating sphere of golden flame. The sphere sheds light as a torch. Up to [dice] times per summon, Banalor can flare and illuminate, briefly, an area 100' in radius. Sighted creatures in the area who are not aware of Banalor's flare must Save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. The flare temporarily cancels magical darkness, which will re-emerge at 10' per round from its source. Banalor's flare does not have the properties of sunlight, but unholy or unnatural creatures will instinctively flinch from it. Banalor knows a great deal about scripture, hymns, and glassworking.

36. Irukan, the Tick of Wakefulness

Enters by scuttling out from the summoner's sleeve or coat. Appears as blue-white tick the size of a thumb, with three beady black eyes. Once persummon, Irukan can attach himself to a living target. For the duration of the summon, the target cannot be fatigued or knocked unconscious, anddoes not require sleep for 10 hours after the summon ends. Irukan will grow gradually more bloated as the summon progresses. He has 1HP and, if burst, anyone within 10' must Save or fall asleep (as per the *sleep *spell.) Irukan does not like being burst, and will give the summoner nightmares. If Irukan is burst 3 times within a week, he will lay painful (1 damage) eggs in the summoner's blood, and in 1d6 weeks a swarm ofbaby ticks will crawl from the summoner's tear ducts. If kept warm and flattered, Irukan can also purify a creature's blood, allowing a new Save vs Disease or Poison.

37. Thosban, Cloak of Beasts

Enters by falling into the summoner's hands. Appears as thick cloak of mixed furs, crudely sewn. Anyone who puts on the cloak and names a furred, flesh-eating beast they have personally killed transforms into that beast for the duration of the summon. They must Save each hour past the first or let the beast's nature take hold. They can remove the cloak at any time, provided they have Saved for the hour. Thosban provides guttural advice, suggesting mayhem, death, and gorging on flesh.
38. Leticular, Stairway Between Realms

Enters silently, subtly, and nearly invisibly. Appears as a faint stairway of glass, rising either up or down (randomly determined.) The steps appear to be 1' high, but in fact raise anyone stepping on them by 1', 10', 100', 1,000', etc. respectively. By the 5th step up, the air becomes cold. The 6th step  up causes nearly instant death by freezing cold and lack of air. Similarly, if the staircase, leads down, you can descend the first 1', 10', 100', and 1000' safely (though you will emerge into solid rock unless you step off very carefully.) By the 5th step, the air is intolerably warm. Any further, and you are either incinerated by the heat or dragged from the stairs by the guardians of Hell. You can step off the stair at any time, and if you carefully judge your step, emerge at a useful height. 

39. Zantaliar, Lord of War

Enters with a stiff march. Appears as a scowling man in heavy robes. Will consult and advise on any matters of military strategy, from the raiding of a camp to the invasion of a continent. His advice is useful to amateurs but redundant and irritating to experts or those unwilling to grasp therealities of war. He will refuse to assist in tomb-robbing, burglary, or other unsavory acts. His advice is no more than a year behind the cutting edgeof the area or conflict he is examining. Zantaliar will not fight for you, and will occasionally shout advice to your enemies if they seem particularly disorganized.
40. Oswing, the Merchant of Delight

Enters from somewhere unseen by the summoner. Appears as a thin grey-skinned man or woman in a pale blue cloak. Up to [sum] times per h69summon, can touch a willing living creature to transport them to a rapturous ecstasy that lasts [dice]+1d6 hours. Only pain can wake them from their vision. Oswing will demand payment for the visions. At first, the payment will be trivial, but it will quickly escalate to outrageous sums, cruel tasks, or impossible items. The weak-willed, the desperate, or the poetic must Save after the first vision or forever desire another. Oswing will notgive you a share of its payments, but will allow the Summoner to enjoy a 1hr vision, per summon, for free. If paid or flattered, it can tell you what visions its clients enjoyed best.

41. Iescophcos, Arrowhead of Sorrow

Enters in the summoner's pocket or boot. Appears as black stone arrowhead, shiny like glass. If placed on a horizontal surface, the arrowhead will rotate to point at the nearest newborn person, no matter the distance. Newborn, in this case, means within thee days of birth. If Iescophcos is brought within 10' of a newborn, it begins to shake. If plunged into a newborn's heart, two effects will occu**R**: the child's heart will forever beat at a steady, slow pace, and on their sixteenth birthday, they will be compelled to seek out and obey (as a permanent *charm person *spell) whoever held the arrowhead at the time they were wounded. The infant is not otherwise harmed. If attached to an arrow, the arrow deals 1d6+[sum] damage on a successful hit, but the summon immediately ends. Iescophcos speaks a language no one can understand. 

42. Antoban, the Harbinger of Winter

Enters in a storm of freezing air, from a nearby door or window. Appears as a pale white humanoid of the same species and gender as the summoner, but stiff and frozen like a frostbitten corpse. An area 100' in radius around Antoban will always be uncomfortably cold. An area 10' in radius around Antoban will, provided Antoban is not moving, become painfully cold (1d4 cold damage per round, unless creatures are well insulated or immune to arctic temperatures.) Antoban takes half damage from all weapons and spells, but double damage from fire. It can discuss the history of winters in the area, focusing on famine, madness, and murder wherever possible. Ice elementals fear and revere Antoban, but it will not command them for any reason. In battle, it wields a short iron sword (1d6 damage.)

43. Noroyo, the Useless Fish

Enters with a loud plop. Appears as a horse-sized fish with green scales and whiskers. Sits quietly, slowly breathing and looking around. Despite being out of the water, will not die. Noroyo's flesh is edible but tastes foul and vanishes at the end of the summon, possibly with disastrous effects. If summoned in water, Noroyo appears as a stunted pony with short limbs, and swiftly sinks. The main use of Noroyo is summoning it in the air to squash your enemies (inflicting 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a typical summon, Save vs Dex negates.) 

44. Uskip, Protector of the Virtuous

Enters with a ringing sound. Appears as a purple disc of light, floating 2' over the summoner's head. Any objects falling on the caster from above, no matter how heavy, are instantly stopped by the disc. If trapped by a rockfall or avalanche, Uskip will shield the summoner and create a small air space around their body. This will not  help the summoner escape, but will prevent them from being crushed or immediately suffocated. Additionally, for the duration of the summon, the summoner gains a +2 to Save vs Magic. Uskip vanishes if the summoner utters any blasphemies or strikes a priest. 

45. Warlence, the Perpetual Relative

Enters with a shuffle. Appears as a peasant in appropriate local dress, with a rucksack full of rags and rotten onions. Up to [dice] times per summon, Warlence can designate a target who is not aware Warlence is an unnatural creature. The target will treat Warlence as a distant relative. At a minimum, this will involve a simple meal (Warlence is ravenous) and a warm bed for one night. Warlence is happy to go along with any deceptions the summoner suggests, but cannot invent lies on its own. Will carry supplies and assist with other simple activities, but will not fight for you.

46. Loswach, the Universal Chisel  

Enters in the caster's hand. Appears as an iron chisel with a wooden handle. Loswach can separate any two layers. You can use it too separate skin from muscle, gold foil from wood, rust from iron, or bark from a tree. You can't separate things that are not fused, so Loswach couldn't chisel the armour off a warrior or the nose off a statue (at least, not any more than a normal chisel could.) In combat, Loswach counts as a dagger. Loswach cannot speak, but it will carve answers to simple questions into stone, if guided by an idle hand.

47. Benlib, Door of Possibilities

Enters on a nearby wall. Appears as an ordinary wooden door. Will allow [sum] creatures plus the summoner to pass through it, once per summon, and walk through any other door the caster has seen and marked with a tiny symbol. The door must be within [dice] miles, and must not be locked or magically protected. Benlib vanishes after [sum] creatures or spells have passed through it. Non-living objects pass through Benlib normally, appearing at the door the summoner designated.

48. Nauox, Tapestry of Lies

Enters with a thump and cloud of dust. Appears as a rolled up tapestry, 6' by 10', with ornate designs featuring scenes from the summoner's life as well as fictional scenes. All of them are slightly embarrassing to the summoner, but this is only noticeable on very close examination. Nauox can speak and insists it is a flying carpet. It is not. It also insists it can crush anyone wrapped in it. This is also a lie. The tapestry is animated, and can walk (very slowly) on its corners. Though it will claim otherwise, it cannot be harmed by acid, fire, or spells. A solid hit from an arrow or spell will knock it over. 

49. Eb, the Tasting Lizard

Enters around the summoner's neck. Appears as a sleek yellow lizard with a bright blue tongue. Eb can taste poison gas on the air, and provide information about the source of odours, smoke, or fog. Eb always knows the local tides, and will tell you which hour in the day will be most propitious for sailing, fishing, or conceiving children. Eb desires warm stones.

50. Yigmarial, the Soul Cache

Enters with a glimmer of light. Appears as a tiny grey cloth effigy of the summoner, with strange wet-looking eyes. For the duration of the summon, the summoner automatically passes all Saves vs Death. Decapitation or extreme bodily harm will still kill the summoner, but almost everything else will merely knock them unconscious. The effigy has 1HP and, if torn, burnt, or damaged, immediately requires the summoner to Save vs Death, which is not automatically passed (of course.)

## Bug Collector

Level 1

Bug Collecting 1
Bug Badges
Save +4 vs Bugs

Level 2

Bug Collecting 2
Bug Buddy

Level 3

Bug Collecting 4
Speak with Insects OR Killing Jar

Level 4+

If you want to expand this class beyond level 3, I wouldn't just increasing the number of bug collected each day (although you could certainly do that).  Instead, I'd give them an expanded table of bugs in each ecosystem with d12 different bugs each.  Bugs number 11-12 have more powerful effects.  Then at level 6, increase it to a d14 table, with two more powerful bugs.  Et cetera.

Bugs are insects, spiders, snails, slugs, and limbless worms of all types.

A Save vs Bugs is a save against any effect that originated from a bug, or any effect that is bug-themed.

Each bug collector begins play with a Butterfly Staff (functions as both a quarterstaff and a butterfly net), a bug journal, and a comfy pair of shorts.



**Bug Collecting**
This is how many bugs you can collect--if you have a positive Intelligence modifier, add it.  Right before dawn, you can spend an hour gathering this many bugs.  At any other time, you can spend 8 hours gathering this many bugs.  You cannot collect more than 2x this number of bugs in a given day.

Each ecosystem has a different selection of bugs.  Bugs are collected randomly.  Each time you get a new bug, enter it in your bug journal.  (DMs: Make up a fun fact about each bug.)  Once you've collected all 10 bugs in each ecosystem at least once, you get a bug badge.

After being collected, each bug only stays alive (and therefore useful) for the rest of the day.  (They're functionally equivalent to spells, in case you were wondering, so this is equivalent to getting a random selection of spells each day.)

Each bug can be used for its effect once, and then the bug either escapes, dies, or is eaten.  This really depends on whatever sort of fiction the DM wants to enforce.  (But I recommend that nursery spiders should be eaten to gain the effects of *spider climb*.)

**Bug Badges**

These are random items that you find near bugs.  It might be a half-eaten leaf or a chrysalis.  To others, it's just a piece of trash.  To you, it is a magic talisman that bestows magical powers.  And, you're right!  But only while you wear it.  However, you can only carry so many bug badges at a time.  If you carry too many, you lose the effects of one of your older ones.

You also get mad respect from other bug collectors.  The number of bug badges is directly proportionate to the chance that you will have more bug badges than other bug collectors.  If you have more bug badges than other bug collectors, you outrank them, and can boss the around.

**Bug Buddy**

You gain a bug buddy of a type chosen by you (butterfly, beetle, non-poisonous centipede, spider, ant, worm, moth, or fly).  This must be a mundane bug without any special powers, no bigger than what you could fit in your (closed) mouth.  The bug has Int 3 and obeys you unhesitatingly.  It can understand commands of up to two words, optionally pointing to something as well.  If your bug buddy dies, you get half the normal XP from this session, and you gain a new bug buddy the next time you go bug collecting.

**Speak With Insects**
This effect is permanent.  Bugs mostly know things related to food and predators.  Poisonous insects are sarcastic.  Shelled insects are gruff.  Worms and caterpillars are naive.  Grasshoppers and crickets are jokesters, and are intelligent to provide pleasant conversation partners.  Ants are boring.  You can also talk to purple worms, who have personalities like furious trucks.

**Killing Jar**
You can store a bug in a killing jar indefinitely, but only *one* bug.  This lets you "lock" one of your collected bugs (spells), so that it lasts beyond the 1-day expiration date.

**Ecosystem: Cave**

1. Albino Cricket: Gain darkvision for 10 minutes.

7. Nubalidia Moth: As *detect magic*.
8. Rust Monster Larva: As a rust monster's rust attack, once.
9. Sacred Scarab: If a ranged attack roll is successful (20' max), bites the target for 1d4 damage immediately, and again on the next two subsequent rounds.  Also incredibly valuable to most mummies, who will bargain in order to possess it.
10. Sacred Sand Lion: Throwable up to 20'  All creatures within 10' must save or be sucked into the sand, dust, or loose dirt that they are standing on.  Only sucks people down 3', so humans will be stuck up to their waist, while dogs will suffocate unless swiftly rescued.

9. Termite Queen: Destroys a shack (or wooden object shack-sized or smaller) in 1 day by devouring all of the wooden components.  Destroys a cottage in 1 week (50% chance of being noticed and stopped halfway through).  Destroys a mansion in 1 month (80% chance of being noticed and stopped halfway through).  Multiple bugs do not increase chance of success.
10. Unlucky Moth: Circles your head.  The next time you would be hit by a small projectile (arrow, slingstone) the moth intercepts it and dies, sparing you the attack.

# To convert

### Blue Mage

They fight as a Fighter. They may not use any armor and may only use daggers, light hammers, clubs, and slings. If for any reason they receive training or proficiency in any other weapon, they fight as a Thief.

**Blue Energy**: Blue Mages have Energy. Their constitution modifier affects their energy pool. A first level Blue Mage with a Constitution of 16 has 3 points in their energy pool.

**Blue Missile**: Blue Mages can conjure and fire a bolt of force. This bolt is as a long bow arrow and they may fire it as a fighter of their level proficient with a long bow. It costs 1 energy to use and does 2-9 damage. This does not count against the limit of their spells and abilities

- Blue Mages may learn special monster attacks and abilities once they have been the target of them. 
- Once targeted by an ability they may choose to **learn the** **monster ability. **
- Learning an ability takes 1 turn after combat.
- They then may **use the monster ability by expending 1 energy point**. 
- Blue Mages may also learn spells, by being the target of a spell. This takes 1 turn after being the target of the spell.
- They can then use the **spells** by expending a number of **energy points equal to the spell level**. 
- Blue Mages may not know more **spells and abilities total** greater than their **level + their Constitution modifier**.
- The ability or spell is learned, even if the Blue Mage dies from the attack.
- If the Blue Mage is protected by spell resistance or a globe of invulnerability, they will not learn the ability. They must be affected, personally, by the ability
- They may learn an ability regardless of the success or failure of their saving throw versus the attack.
- They must be a target of a spell or ability to learn it, seeing it is not enough.
- Energy points are refreshed after a nights rest.

**

**Azure Consumption**: The Blue Mage can attempt to learn passive or defensive abilities from creatures by eating them. They must save versus poison after consuming a corpse to learn the ability. Otherwise they are sick and vomit up the corpse which is ruined. A whole corpse must be consumed and this takes 1 turn.

Each of these passive abilities counts against the total number of abilities the Blue Mage can learn. Each passive ability 1 point of energy to maintain, reducing the available energy to cast blue magic. These abilities are always 'on' and cannot be turned off to regain access to the reserved energy points.

Examples of Blue Magic:

Surviving a Basilisks gaze

Conversions should be made so that the Blue Mage can have useful abilities of the opponents in the spirit of the original ability e.g. Dragons breath takes 1/3 of the energy points because Dragons can use it 3/day, The stinger of the killer bee doesn't kill the caster, but does hurt him.
