# Racial Classes

For context, see how classes and leveling work in [this earlier post](Classes and Leveling).

# Class: Dwarf

Starting Equipment: leather armor, axe, iron shield

Starting Skill: craftsmanship

A: Innate sense

B: Obsession

C: Heart of the Mountain

D: Liver of the Delver

You gain +1 HP for each Dwarf template you possess.

**A: Innate sense**

Can smell/taste craftsmanship within 10'. This may be hampered by other overwhelming odors.

When a dwarf dies from poison or disease, it turns into stone for 1d6 days, then returns to life.

**B: Greedy Obsession**

Gain a bonus to saves for each slot of *treasure* carried beyond 5 slots.

Every time you rest in a civilized location, roll 1d20. On a 1, spend 1d20 days obsessed with making an object of power. Then roll 1d4 to see how great it is. A 1 means it is wonderful and 4 means its utility is questionable. Describe what you'd like it to be and the referee will describe what it actually is.

**C: Heart of the Mountain**

Always knows when all the secret doors and passages on a floor have been discovered.

**D: Liver of the Delver**

Can sense the general direction of exits, stairs, and the like.
