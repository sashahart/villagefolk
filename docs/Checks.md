# Checks

## Check

> **Stat Check**: roll a D20 equal to target value or under target value.

Sometimes, the referee might ask a player character to make a check against a stat. For example, MOVE might be checked to attempt to jump over a pit or STR might be checked to attempt to push a heavy or stuck object.

To check a stat, a player rolls 1D20 and, if the result is less than or equal to the stat (this is the "Target Number"), the check succeeds. If the roll is greater than the ability, the check fails.

An unmodified (natural) roll of 1 is always a success and a natural 20 is always a failure, regardless of penalties and bonuses.

------

Example: A player character checks their MOVE stat to jump over a pit. The player character has a move score of 12 but the pit is dangerously wide, so the Referee imposes a +2 penalty. The player rolls a 12. This would normally be a success, but the penalty means that the result is a 14. The player character falls into the pit.

## Penalties and bonuses

Whenever a player makes a check, bonuses or penalties may be applied to the target number, with a modifier of +3 resulting in a much easier check and a -3 resulting in a much more difficult check. Just use -3, -2, +2, and +3. Other numbers are for very unusual circumstances.

------

Miranda has a character named Sammi. Sammi's target foe is not visible (perhaps a human hiding in an unlit room.) The referee assigns a -10 penalty to Sammi's ATK. This means that, even though Sammi's sheet says that her ATK is 11, in the dark, her ATK is only 1. This means the player would need to roll a 1 to succeed at hitting the enemy.

However, imagine this: Miranda says "Sammi is going to wait to swing her sword until she hears something standing near her, paying attention to the direction of the sound. She will swing the sword wide, in a circle." The Referee might now change the penalty to just -2 if the foe is not taking care to be quiet, but if she misses, she'll hit someone else in her party, if they don't hurry to get out of the way.

Add a Cover example. 

A PC hiding behind a door might get a +3 to defensive rolls. A PC hiding behind a 4' tall rock might only get +2.

## Opposed Stat Check

> **Opposed Check: ATR + [10-Opposing ATR]**

An opposed check is a check that has a penalty (or bonus) based on an opposing force. The target number to roll under is the sum of the player character's relevant attribute score and 10 minus the opposing attribute.

------

To quickly simulate a game of chess against a very wily wizard, an opposed intelligence check might look like this:

Player Character intelligence: 10. 
Wizard intelligence (as defined by the referee at the moment the check is made): 18.

ATR + [10-Opposing ATR] = opposed check
10 + [10-18] = opposed check
10 + [-8] = 2 = opposed check

In this case, the player must roll a 1 or 2 to succeed at the opposed check and win the game of chess.

If the player character has a "Games" Tag or if the player character finds a way to distract the wizard, a bonus to the check would be gained.

If the wizard is being pleaded with by an urchin claiming to be his son, the referee might decide to award a bonus of 2 to the check. Now the player character only needs to roll 4 or under to succeed.
