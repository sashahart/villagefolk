The Referee has environments and situations, not a pre-planned “story” of any kind
Players drive things forward with their choices
The game is dangerous. The Referee is not there to kill your characters, but neither is he there to protect them. Dice are rolled out in the open. Death is part of the game. (Luckily, new characters are easy to roll up!)
The situations you encounter are not “balanced.” You might want to avoid encounters, you might want to flee encounters, and if you choose to engage them you’ll want to have the PCs manipulate the fiction toward your advantage (Short hand: Think of conflicts as asymmetrical warfare, not as engaging in a sport.)
In this kind of play the Referee presents the players with an environment that is as solid as possible, that would continue existing if you weren’t there.



# Principia Apocrypha

Honor the dice and the players. Divest yourself of their fate.
Build responsive situations. Leave preparation flexible.

Uphold logic. Let them go off the rails. Make them think

Player ingenuity over characterability. Cleverness rewarded, not thwarted. Ask them how they do it. 

Let them manipulate the world. Make tools unique. Don’t mind the fourth wall

Challenge them. Offer tough choices. Build challenges with  multiple answers and challenges with no answer. Subvert their expectations.

Instill fear, deal death. Deadly but avoidable combat. Keep up the pressure. Telegraph deadliness, but let the dice kill them.

Fill their senses

Reveal the world. Give them layers to peel back.. Bring the world to life. See your world as real. Make your details matter

# 30 Principles of Adventure Design

**Bryce Lynch, summary by Jon Miller**

#### I.General Tips: The 5 C’s

1. **Color**: The referee should give brief but evocative descriptions of locations, monsters, NPCs, and treasures. Avoid the vague or generic.
2. **Context**: In order for their actions to be significant and purposeful, players must generally have some information about the likely consequences of their actions, such as likely reactions of monsters or NPCs.
3. **Choices**: There should be more than one course of action available to players in order for the adventure to continue. Avoid choke points—both literal choke points in the physical layouts of dungeons and other locations, and figurative choke points which require a unique decision or solution in order for the adventure to proceed.
4. **Consequences**: Player actions should be allowed to make a real difference in the adventure and in the campaign. Avoid a set storyline or sequence of events immune to player interference.

5. **Creativity**:Related to (3) and (4), reward player creativity by allowing them to pursue unanticipated courses of action or to produce unanticipated consequences,rather than restricting player action and player creativity by setting up arbitrary constraints in the location layout or course of events.

#### II. Hooks

6. Don’t rely on a single hook; use multiple kinds [(treasure; reward; magic; glory; politicalpower).]()[[1\]](#_msocom_1) 

7. Create a rumor table with hooks and color.
8. Hooks should appeal to the players (not just their characters).
9. Hooks can and should be made complex / nuanced; e.g., working for an evil NPC, or working for rival factions.
10. To support sandbox play, particular dungeon, town, and wilderness locations, monsters, and NPCs should all have hooks.

#### III. Locations

11. Location descriptions should be terse (not verbose) but evocative(not boring, obvious, generic).

12. Only include background info that affects gameplay. Avoid long descriptions of irrelevant info.


13. Rooms should have features that players can interact with to produce meaningful consequences. Give concrete descriptions of secret doors,traps, etc.


14. Floor plan tips:

a.   Multiple routes (vs. choke points or linear, one-way paths).

b.   Multiple entrances / exits.

c.    Multiple stairs per floor.

d.   Open spaces with balconies,galleries, and ledges at various elevations.

e.   Pools and rivers that connect different rooms or levels.

f.    Bridges and ladders.

#### IV. Monsters and NPCs

15. Create interesting, believable motivations for monsters and NPCs.

16. Create factions of monsters and NPCs (which lead to a dynamic,interconnected strategic situation).


17. Give players the choice of allying, attacking, or having other relationships with monsters and NPCs.
18. Create schedules, routines, tactics, and orders of battle for monsters and NPCs.
19. Wandering monsters too should be given motives, goals, hooks, and tactics.
20. Avoid standard monsters. Failing that, describe standard monsters in a non-standard way (e.g., don’t just name their species).
21. Give evocative descriptions of monsters. Give concrete descriptions of their appearance and activities. Go for the telltale sensory detail, rather than the generic abstract trait. Show, don’t tell. Example: Instead of stating that “One of the guards in the camp is a cruel bully,” say that “The burly Manfred takes a leak on poor Tobias’s bedroll, and then he snatches Tobias's roasted chicken dinner from his hand and quickly gobbles it down.”
22. Use truly evil monsters to evoke a Sense of Terror.

#### V. Treasure

23. Treasure should be valuable enough to motivate players and to make the challenges worthwhile.
24. Non-magical treasure should relate to the setting and give clues or information about monsters, NPCs, locations, etc.
25. Avoid standard magic items.
26. Give evocative descriptions of magic items. Give concrete descriptions of their appearance and how they must be manipulated to produce their magical effects.
27. Use magic items to evoke a Sense of Wonder.

#### VI.Format and Functionality

28. Include the following kinds of references:

a.    Rumor / hook table.

b.    Monster / NPC table which lists their main traits, motivations, location, etc.

c.     Room / building table which lists the rooms in a dungeon (or other keyed locations).

29. In published modules, put maps and monster stats on separate sheets(so they are easy to refer to in play).

30. On maps, use keyed symbols to indicate standard features (e.g., lit / unlit, locked / unlocked, secret, trapped, etc.), rather than a verbal description in the location key.

## To Roll or Not To Roll

Only roll or call for a roll if both failure and success areinteresting. If failure is inevitable because of the fiction, don't roll. A PCcan't test Strength to flap your arms and fly to the moon. They can't testDexterity to dodge the ground after a 300' fall.

 

If failure is boring, don't roll. If the PCs fail to pick a simplemundane lock, and they have all the time in the world, they'll just keeprolling until they succeed. Just let them open it. If the PCs not spottingsomething means they'll never see it, just tell them what they see. No rollsrequired.

 

Failed rolls have consequences. The most obvious one is time. Afailed roll means wasted time, and wasted time means more opportunity for badthings to happen to the PCs. Merely failing a roll in combat shouldn't bepenalized beyond a wasted attack,but a critical failure (an unmodified roll of 20) might result in additional consequences.

 

Roll sparingly. Because Stats are randomly generated and assigned,it is possible that two PCs in the same party will have vastly differentchances of performing the same task. Minimize this by using Attack and Save(which are the same for most PCs at the same Level), automatic failures, andautomatic successes.


From a player's point of view, a roll is a risk. Testing Strength toleap across a chasm is risky. Putting a ladder across a chasm and carefullyclimbing across does not require a roll. Fighting an orc in melee is a risk.Avoiding the fight entirely might not require a roll.
