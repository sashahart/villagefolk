## Barbarian

Starting Equipment: heavy weapon, leather armour

Starting Skill: Foreign Parts. Also, see below.

A: Rage

B: Danger Sense, A Taste of Home

C: Feat of Strength, Die Hard

D: Tough

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess. You get +1 Stealth if you possess 2 Barbarian templates.  

**Rage **

You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. While in a rage, you have +1 Attack stat, all your melee attacks inflict +1 damage, and are immune to pain and fear. You might froth, or stare in battle-focus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

While raging, you cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things. Spellcasting is not impossible, but all your spells must be damaging spells, which deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets.) Mishaps and Dooms may be more severe. While raging, you cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. You can will yourself to stop raging with a 2-in-6 chance of success at the start of your turn as a free action. If one of your allies has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

**Danger Sense **

If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act on the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can roll under your Intelligence to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.

**A Taste of Home**

You can consume a special ration to regain 1d6+1 HP. This takes 1 round. Examples: an [alcoholic drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvavit), a strange fruit or [vegetable](https://youtu.be/3JNt3EpCJZU?t=902), an unusual[herb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khat.) One use costs 1gp and can be purchased in any trading city. 3 "doses" fit in a single inventory slot. You cannot do this while raging, but you can immediately enter a rage after eating the ration. If you have any Lethal Damage, you instead heal to 0 HP. If an ally waves the ration under you nose, you can Save vs Constitution to wake up. You may play a theme tune (or a *leitmotif*, if you're classy.)

**Feat of Strength **

Once per day as a free action, you have 22 Strength for 1 round. Can also be used in combat (your Strength Bonus is 4.) 

**Die Hard**

You have 4 rounds to remove all your [Fatal Wounds](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-death-and-dismemberment-table-early.html?showComment=1500610863104#c5538797767091825435), rather than 3.

**Tough**

 Reduce all incoming damage by 1 point. You gain a +2 to Save vs mind-altering spells.

### Mechanical Notes on the Barbarian

Fighters are all about damage output. Knights are tanks with high defense and the ability to attract attention. Barbarians soak damage instead. They have high HP and the ability to heal in combat. They also usually go first. with a side ability of "knowing really obscure stuff." Rather than oiled-up illiterate goons, Barbarians can come from many backgrounds and use many skills. The generic feudal setting I'm using is based on 10th-14th century France, England, and Germany. Barbarians could be based on almost any other "foreign" culture, from Scotland to Syria to Mongolia to even more unlikely locations. The core of a Barbarian might be their ability to fight, but the real advantage is their association with the unknown.

### Starting Skill

1. Mountaineer, 2. Raider, 3. Horses, 4. Soldier, 5. Sailor, 6. Unusual

You are from Foreign Parts. The language of the people Around Here is strange to you; their customs are unusual and sometimes amusing. You might worship the Authority as they do, but you might also be from a heretical sect or a pagan. Unless your background states otherwise, you can a start as a member of the First or Third Estates, or as an Outlaw. Barbarians can be male or female; they do things differently in Foreign Parts. To a certain extent you bring your own laws and customs with you.

**Mountaineer**

You cannot wear chain armour or plate armour.

1. You lived in the high alpine passes. When you weren't farming goats you were feuding with your neighbors. Start with 1 goat and a set of winter clothes. 
2. You were a prince of a great nation who lived in valleys between mountains that cut through the clouds. You are innately superior, and know how to behave like a noble. Gain the "Courtesy" skill, 1gp, and the starting [Noble Rank ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html)of 1 with an upkeep of 12gp/month. Your clothes were fancy in your homeland.
3. You were a great skirmisher and high-pass fighter. Start with 50' of rope, a grappling hook, and a weather-worn face.
4. You lived in the back of a great glacier or on a trackless snowfield in the north. Start with a pair of bone [snow goggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_goggles.) Each morning, if you wake up above ground, you can Save vs Wisdom to tell what the weather will be like that day.
5. You are a mercenary and a guide. Sometimes, you lead armies to their death. Sometimes, you lead them through impossible terrain. Start with 1d10sp and a spare sword.
6. You searched the mountains for rare beasts. Start with fur robes worth 50gp that you wouldn't sell even if threatened with a horrible death. You killed the animal yourself. Feel free to a name and describe it.

**Raider**

You cannot wear plate armour.

1. You were part of a mercenary army, brought here to fight a conflict and shattered by the result. You do not know the way home. Start with a horse and a shield.
2. Your appearance is so outlandish even educated and well-traveled people will stop to stare at you. The difference might be minor to modern eyes. You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma in situations where your novel appearance or dress might provoke interest (court, seduction) and a -2 penalty to Charisma when it would cause fear or discomfort (peasant gatherings, church services.)
3. Your culture rewards death in battle against impossible odds. You must Save to retreat from a fight. You may reroll a failed Save vs Fear if your immediate response, if you succeed, is to rage and charge.
4. You were an expert looter, raiding caravans, cities, and travellers alike. Start with brightly coloured clothes made from the torn silks of your enemies.You can evaluate the worth of looted treasure (as a Thief.)
5. You know how to frighten the weak-willed and inexperienced. Start with a pot of war paint. It takes you an entire round to enter a rage, and you must spend that round [chanting, dancing,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haka) or [displaying your weapons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw.) You can maintain this pre-battle rage-chant for as many rounds as you need to without attacking. This may force your enemies to make a Morale check or Save vs Fear. 
6. You are an expert slave-catcher. If you make a Combat Manuver and grapple a human-sized target, you can also disarm them.

**Horses**

You cannot wear plate armour.

1. You are completely at ease in the saddle of a horse. You start with a bow and 20 arrows, but no horse (it died recently, and you need to earn enough to buy a new one.)
2. You have a riding animal of an unusual breed (a six-legged horse, a camel, a giant centipede, a huge bird.) It is identical to a horse in all mechanical respects, and too weird for anyone around here to buy. If it dies, you can try to buy a replacement at a major city for a minimum of 200gp. You can also ride a normal horse but it's just not the same.
3. You can instantly evaluate a horse's condition and worth just by inspecting it. If you sell a horse, you always get a good price.
4. You were part of a knightly order in Foreign Parts, sent here as part of a failed diplomatic effort. Your master might be dead, but you have committed no crime, and see opportunities in these lands that would be denied to you at home. Gain the "Courtesy" skill, 1gp, and the starting[Noble Rank ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html)of 1 with an upkeep of 12gp/month.
5. You are part of a vast warrior nation that lurks just beyond the horizon. You were exiled for a shameful crime and can never return to your homeland. Start with a horse and a ceremonial dagger.
6. You are an expert on riding on any terrain. Start with a horse. While riding, you never need to make checks to move over steep slopes, uneven ground, small streams, etc.

**Soldier**

1. You were born into a mercenary family and have know no other life. Start with 1gp and 1 [Camp Follower.](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html)
2. You have fought in half a dozen wars in places most people can barely imagine. Your long and loyal service was not rewarded, but your amazing tales will earn you friends.
3. You were an expert night-raider, and took many captives by the light of the overcast moon. You can see as well in dim light above-ground as most people can see in daylight.
4. Your tribe's battle-rage is terrifying to behold. If you kill an enemy,  you can spend the subsequent round defiling the corpse, shouting, or holding your bloody weapon over your head to force a Save vs. Fear or a Morale check among your enemies (and potentially your allies.)
5. You came from a tribe of brawlers. You can throw any solid object to deal 1d6+Strength bonus damage, with a -1 penalty to attack for every 10' past the first.
6. You have fists of steel and callouses like iron plates. Your unarmed attacks deal 1d6+Strength bonus damage. You can also crush walnuts and skulls with your bare hands.

**Sailor**

You cannot wear chain armour or plate armour.

1. You can swim, even in leather armor. Unless you're a fishling this is a rare skill indeed.
2. Your ship was half-wrecked in a storm and you drifted for months. You have no idea how to get home, but you prefer it here anyway. Make up 1d6 ludicrous lies about Foreign Parts.
3. The horrifying things you saw while you were at sea convinced you that dry land - any land - was better and safer. Gain +2 to Save vs Fear.
4. You kissed a mermaid once. Water elementals will not harm you unless seriously provoked. The first time you would die due to drowning, you are instead tossed to the surface with 0 HP.
5. You raided a monastery from the sea but underwent a miraculous conversion. You will not harm any monk or nun. Start in the First Estate with a great deal of residual guilt.
6. You guarded a merchant who died on a sea voyage. Start with 1d10gp. You can speak a dozen languages. 

**Unusual**

You gain the skill listed, not the "Unusual" skill.

1. You were a holy warrior, fighting for a cause no one Around Here even knows about. Gain the "Religion" skill.
2. You know a secret ritual to call the souls of your victims back into the living world. Once per week, you can cast *speak with dead*, targeting a creature you personally killed. The creature's head must be intact. If the creature *really *hates you and has sufficient willpower, it can Save to return fully, becoming a ghost, an embodied undead, or possessing someone nearby. You don't know this can happen. Gain the "History" skill.
3. You have hardened your soul. If a spell requires you to Save, unless it is a Save to Dodge, you gain a +2 bonus to y our Save. If you are aware the spell is being cast and do nothing but prepare yourself, you gain a +4 bonus instead. Gain the "Religion" skill.
4. You are a natural leader, although you are not a noble in any way. Hirelings can reroll failed Saves vs. Fear or Morale checks if they can see you. Gain the "Siege Warfare" skill.
5. You were dispatched from Foreign Parts to fulfill some ambiguous prophecy. If a suitably dramatic event occurs, you can declare that the prophecy is fulfilled. Gain a +2 to all Saves for the rest of the encounter and a sense of emptiness if you survive. You can only do this once. Start with the "Farmer" skill.
6. You cannot lie under any circumstances. Your oaths are very powerful. Start with the "Solider" skill. 



[Barbarians](http://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/09/osr-class-barbarians.html) get to eat a special ration to restore HP. Here are 1d100 delicacies for people from Foreign Parts, where they'll eat *anything*. 

Items on this list cost 1gp per serving and are only available in major trading cities. People from Foreign Parts buy them to remind themselves of home; everyone else think the items listed are disgusting, confusing, or a complete waste of time.

| 1d100                |                         |                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Meat**             |                         |                                                              |
| 1                    | Hanging meat.           | Salt it, flatten it, leave it to air-dry until it falls apart. Really tough, a little green around the edges. |
| 2                    | Pickled eyeballs.       | Mostly flavorless, slightly greasy, hard to explain to visitors. |
| 3                    | Dried eel.              | Leathery. Smells like wet dog.                               |
| 4                    | Weird bit.              | The tendon from the left leg. The wattle. The gizzard. Something you wouldn't normally eat. |
| 5                    | Blended organ sack.     | A stomach filled with other bits of animal and special spices, left to ferment. |
| 6                    | Rotting fish.           | Has to be a very specific kind of fish. Carried in glass bottles. Smells like death. |
| 7                    | Dried crickets.         | Served in honey. Well attested in holy books; less appealing these days. |
| 8                    | Fermented crab.         | PC swears it's an aphrodisiac; everyone else thinks the smell is off-putting. |
| 9                    | Dried meat.             | Mashed with fat and berries and dried in strips. Tastes like the bottom of a gardener's boot. |
| 10                   | Mashed stoat.           | Minty fresh for some reason.                                 |
| **More Meat**        |                         |                                                              |
| 11                   | Baked rat.              | Except it's not a local rat. It's some kind of smug-looking foreign rat. |
| 12                   | Pig grease.             | The leftovers from a thousand plates of fried pork. Crunchy. Kept in a jar. |
| 13                   | Mashed ants.            | Lured out by the PC and cooked in a pot, then mixed with grain. Terrifyingly awful. |
| 14                   | Whole songbird.         | Would be fine, but it's coated in some sort of black foul-smelling paste. |
| 15                   | Fermented bird.         | Store it in a sack then drink whatever drips out. Absolutely awful. |
| 16                   | Dried lizards.          | Tiny. Eat a handful at a time. Crunchy but extremely dry.    |
| 17                   | Rabbit ears.            | Why the ears? And why eat them with the fur still on?        |
| 18                   | Sea thing.              | Horrible little sea insect. Too many legs, bright pink, baked then preserved in red sauce. |
| 19                   | Tiny flat fish.         | Smoked, and then kept in a sack. Eaten whole. Pungent smell and scales everywhere. |
| 20                   | Teeth.                  | Handfuls of broken teeth from all sorts of animals. Swallowed whole. |
| **Eggs**             |                         |                                                              |
| 21                   | Eggs, cooked.           | Boiled in something unpleasant, left to dry in the sun. Tastes like battery acid. |
| 22                   | Eggs, fermented.        | Buried in clay for a month. Sulphrous, crumbly.              |
| 23                   | Eggs, mashed.           | Mixed with some horrible root. Smells like burnt meat.       |
| 24                   | Eggs, candied.          | Put in an urn with weird roots. Crystallized, snaps like glass, tastes like hair. |
| 25                   | Eggs, fish.             | Lots of little tiny ones, black like stones. Briny, unpleasant aftertaste. |
| 26                   | Eggs, insect.           | White, the size of a thumb, taste like soap.                 |
| 27                   | Eggs, lumpy.            | From a bird with the hiccoughs, maybe. Bulges. Tastes like milk. |
| 28                   | Eggs, snail.            | Pickled in brine. Thin shell, tastes like mushrooms, slight worries of snails hatching inside you. |
| 29                   | Eggs, sea.              | Not sure if they are from a plant or a fish. Large, green, briny pouches. |
| 30                   | Eggs, exotic.           | Blue and green with stripes. From somewhere in the mountains. Watery and sulphrous. |
| **Strong Drink**     |                         |                                                              |
| 31                   | Horrible herbal liquor. | Sold in tiny glass bottles, vaguely greasy taste.            |
| 32                   | Blessed water.          | Blessed by a particular saint or god. The PC can taste the difference. |
| 33                   | Green infusion.         | Apparently made by monks. These monks must be real sick bastards. |
| 34                   | Brown liquor.           | Very strong, made by alchemists, dries out your throat.      |
| 35                   | Honey beer.             | Comes in clay pots. Delicious but distinctly foreign.        |
| 36                   | Fermented cloves.       | More of a mash than a drink. Will make your earwax run.      |
| 37                   | Red liquor.             | Thick like treacle, tastes like fruit, but makes everyone but the PC throw up 10 mins later. |
| 38                   | Bitter leaves.          | Make a horrible medicinal drink if soaked in boiling water. The PC eats them raw in emergencies. |
| 39                   | Pale brown liquor.      | Made from trees, somehow. Tastes like pine needles, sap, and splinters. |
| 40                   | Buttery wine.           | Not made from grapes, that's for sure. Strong, but kind of slimy. Starchy flavour. |
| **Root Vegetables**  |                         |                                                              |
| 41                   | Fat purple turnips.     | Kind of tasty if cooked, but the PC insists on eating them raw. |
| 42                   | Long grey carrots.      | Very very spicy.                                             |
| 43                   | Rock-like vegetable.    | Devoured raw, leaks milk. Utterly disgusting.                |
| 44                   | Round green lumps.      | Some kind of nut? No one is sure. Incredibly bitter aftertaste. |
| 45                   | Thin white roots.       | Served by the handful. Faint smell of cut hay.               |
| 46                   | Corkscrew turnips.      | Worse than regular turnips in every way, from appearance to texture to cost. |
| 47                   | Fat white root.         | Like an obsese carrot, but it tastes like sweat. When dried it starts to fall apart. |
| 48                   | Horrible onion.         | Red, not yellow, and sharply acidic. The devil's onions.     |
| 49                   | Lumpy root.             | Shaped like a deformed person or a sick animal. Orange and fibrous, strong flavour. Chewed. |
| 50                   | Hairy yellow root.      | From a flower. Tastes like vinegar, but it keeps away insects. |
| **Leafy Vegetables** |                         |                                                              |
| 51                   | Broad green leaves.     | Opens the pupils, increases the heart rate, makes the PC talk very quickly. |
| 52                   | Diamond leaves.         | Tingly, stains the teeth green, fairly mild flavour.         |
| 53                   | Small grey leaves.      | Ashy. Sold by apothecaries. Strong hallucinogen, PC is immune. |
| 54                   | Stringy frayed leaves.  | Tastes like soap. PC insists it does not taste like soap.    |
| 55                   | Flat green leaves.      | Bitter, watery. Slowly rot into a dripping mass that is still, somehow, edible. |
| 56                   | Fern leaves.            | Taste like grass, but with runny sap. Stains the teeth green. |
| 57                   | Orange leaves.          | Dried and crispy. Crushed up and held under the tongue. Makes the PC sleepy an hour later. |
| 58                   | Little round leaves.    | Tastes like copper and makes everyone but the PC sneeze uncontrollably. |
| 59                   | Veiny lumpy leaves.     | Bitter and horribly chewy. Like eating a sheet of lead.      |
| 60                   | Curled-up leaves.       | Little balls of green, swallowed whole. Gives everyone but the PC gas. |
| **Bread**            |                         |                                                              |
| 61                   | Hard cakes.             | Why would anyone do that to bread? So dense they hurt your teeth. |
| 62                   | Drip cakes.             | Bread thrown into boiling fat. Extremely weird.              |
| 63                   | Spice bread.            | A pinch of spice from Foreign Parts. Tastes like leather.    |
| 64                   | Rolled bread.           | Layered meat and cheese inside bread. Looks appetizing, but the spices used are very unusual. |
| 65                   | Yellow bread.           | Made from some some grain from Foreign Parts. Gritty.        |
| 66                   | Corpse bread.           | Like bread that's been left to die. So stale, so crunchy. Squeaks when you eat it. |
| 67                   | Hole bread.             | The baker must be mad because it's full of air and holes!    |

| 80                   | Meat cheese.            | The PC insists on making it with things from the ocean and not pork or beef trimmings. |

| 92                   | White beans.            | Like pebbles, but chewy. After a few minutes your tongue goes numb. |
| 93                   | Red beans.              | Taste metallic, deeply unpleasant. Apparently very good for you in large quantities. |
| 94                   | Horrible sea thing.     | Orange. Looks like a deflated penis. Probably tastes like a deflated penis. |

| 97                   | Snake venom.            | Makes the tongue go black. Not enough to kill anyone if ingested. |
| 98                   | Pink salt.              | From the mountains. Apparently heals you and makes your hair grow. Just tastes like salt. |
| 99                   | Cat milk.               | Seriously, who milks a cat? A thin crusty rind of milk.      |
| 100                  | Magic powder.           | Ground up wizard skulls or something. Makes your hair stick striaight out and your eyes bulge. |
