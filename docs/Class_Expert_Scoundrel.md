## **Signature Tool**

Propose an item to your GM. These are usually things held in a hand that are not weapons. However, weapons of great utility (instead of great damage) may be chosen.

Gain an instance of the item. Name it and describe its appearance, if you like. It's an extension of yourself. It may, however, be replaced by another object of the same kind if you lose or destroy it.

Once per day you may automatically succeed at doing something beyond what a normal adventurer would be able to do with the Signature Item. It must be something that, however, could be done by the world's foremost expert on the use of that object. Your ability is not magical and it cannot be used to generate extra damage.

When you do this, roll a d6. If you roll a 5 or 6, something terrible will happen in addition to your success.

The GM must make the terrible thing related to the thing that you succeeded at, in some way, if possible. The sooner it happens, the better, but it doesn't have to happen immediately. I mean like the whip breaking or something karmic, like someone who believes whips are sinful showing up. 

**Example terrible things:**

1. It breaks.
2. Someone tries to steal the object at the soonest opportunity.
3. Your feat harms yourself or another.
4. Your feat has unintended consequences.
5. A rival who is also an expert in the use of that object (or in the use of another object) will eventually arrive.

**Example Signature items**

1. Whip. Swing from a chandelier. Yoink a little golden statue.
2. Hammer and Chisel. Create beautiful works of art. Provide components for contraptions. Alter architecture. Shape bone to make prosthetics, false teeth (with a capsule inside.) Perfectly imitate the ancient reliefs in the dungeon.
3. Cane. Use to strike with the point or length (perhaps more to startle, stun, or knockout than to simply do mundane hit points), parry; throw to achieve same result; throw with a twist so the cane lodges in a gap to hold things apart.

4. Glue. Piece together a smashed pot. Scale an unscalable wall.
5. Playing Cards. You can throw/spin a card shaped item to place it. Sharp & strong items could be used like shuriken, to damage or cut open/sever twine. Or to place an item as fake evidence or as a dead drop message. As well as all the obvious card sharp shuffling and sleight of hand.  (Thanks to [Alistair Langsford](https://notifications.google.com/u/0/117865116271093018397) )
6. Slingshot. Hit the tiny pressure plate of a trap at a distance. 
7. Dagger. 
8. Lute. Pacify a beast.
9. Tobacco pipe. Make perfect shapes of smoke to use as a signal. 
10. Needle & Thread. Attach a mirror to your sleeve. Attach a hooked vial of poison to your ulna (a wristbone.)
11. Paintbrush. Invent fingerprinting. Tickle a giants feet with such precision that it simply shifts its feet in reaction instead of waking up.

## **Always Prepared**

In town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabeled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, donâ€™t cost more than you originally paid, and are available in town. You can put multiple items inside a large Unlabeled Package, including smaller Unlabeled Packages. You can have no more than two Unlabeled Packages at a time.

## **Intuition**

After you make a regular check and are doing something that should require expertise (this is called "using an untrained skill"), you may  increase the target number of the roll by +4. You must make this choice before the GM narrates the result of your roll. You may do this twice per day. This does not apply to things that any adventurer would be able to do without special knowledge, training, or skill.

Example: You attempt to cut a ruby from a statue's eye-socket without damaging the stonework. You have no masonry skill, so the GM requests a dexterity check at a penalty of -4. Your dexterity is 12, so you have to roll under 8 to succeed. You roll a 9 and fail. Before the GM narrates the result, you increase the target number by 4, making your 9 a success.

## **Opportunist**

Whenever you get a situational bonus to an Attack roll (surprise, elevation, etc) you deal an additional +1d6 Damage.
