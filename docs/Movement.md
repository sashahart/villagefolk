# Movement

> **MOVE** = 12 + DEX MOD - ENC.
>
> Party MOVE = lowest MOVE score.

Check MOVE to climb, jump, or flee.

Party movement rate is determined by the speed of the slowest member.

Moving at a fast pace prevents mapping. Characters aren't able to observe their environment as carefully.

## Dungeon Exploration

> **Exploration** = MOVE*10'.

## Movement in Encounters

> **Combat Round** = MOVE*10'÷3.

## Overland Travel

When traveling across plains a character may travel as many miles as their movement score in a day, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 6, without gaining FATIGUE. (This is because a hex is typically 6 miles wide. A party cannot partially enter a hex.)

| Party MOVEMENT | Miles per day without FATIGUE | Hexes per day without FATIGUE | Hours per hex |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1-5            | 0                             | 0                             | Cannot travel |
| 6-11           | 6                             | 1                             | 12            |
| 12-17          | 12                            | 2                             | 6             |
| 18-23          | 18                            | 3                             | 4             |
| 24-35          | 24                            | 4                             | 3             |
| 36-71          | 36                            | 6                             | 2             |
| 72             | 72                            | 12                            | 1             |

------

The average party member has a movement of 12. If the slowest party member has a movement of 12, the party may explore 6 miles in 6 hours.

### To Travel

> 7-(MOVE÷3) = hours to cross 6 miles of **Plains**.
>
> **Road** = -2 hours (min of 1 hour.)
>
> **Hill** = +1 hour.
>
> **Forest and Desert** = +2 hours.
>
> **Jungle and Swamp**  = +3 hours.
>
> **Mountain**  = +4 hours.

When traveling outdoors, away from a settlement, consult the Overland Travel Chart to determine the number of hours it will take, based on the slowest party member's movement rate.

Traveling more than 12 hours adds 1 fatigue per hour. See *Conditions*.

### Daylight

Traveling at night is nearly impossible without a road. (You might choose to make an exception for a full moon.) 

When night travel occurs, increase the probability of a random encounter by one die face at night. (This usually means a 2 in 6 chance of an encounter.)

Winter - 8 hours of light
Spring/Fall - 11 hours of light
Summer - 14 hours of light

### Navigating Accurately

To navigate accurately (without getting lost,) check MOVE with the following changes:

Plain = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]+7 
Mountain, Hill, Forest = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]-5
Desert, Jungle, Swamp = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]-2

Keeping a large landmark in sight can improve or ensure the chances of accurate navigation, according to the referee's decision.

When lost, the party randomly moves to a different hex adjacent to the one intended.

------

> Alternately, the GM can roll 1d6 and consult the Overland Travel Chart to determine whether the party becomes lost. This allows the referee to avoid telling the players that they went the wrong way allowing nothing more than a description the environment they find themselves moving through.

> To stay on-track, roll 1d6
>
> Road: never
>
> Plain: 1-5
>
> Mountain, Hill, Forest: 1-2
>
> Desert, Jungle, Swamp: 1-3

### Hex Travel

The standard hex size is 6 miles wide.

For the sake of simplicity, assume the party is at the center of the hex they begin in and that their destination is at the center of the hex they stop traveling in.

------

When moving from one 6-mile hex into another one, the total distance travelled is 6 miles. 

When moving all the way across one hex and ending in a new hex adjacent to it, the distance travelled is 9 miles.

### Exploring a hex

|                | Obvious   | Not Obvious | Hidden           | Well-hidden |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **D6 result**  | [No Roll] | 1-3         | 1-2              | 1           |
| **MOVE Check** | [No Roll] | MOVE+WIS-2  | Check MOVE+WIS-5 | MOVE+WiS-9  |

Obvious features are discovered upon moving into a hex.

To explore the hex the characters are in, spend the same number of hours it would cost to move into the current hex (consult the Overland Travel Chart.) Then roll 1d6 to determine if unnoticed features of interest are discovered. (Give a bonus to this roll equal to the Wisdom modifier of a party member who has knowledge of this kind of terrain.)

> Alternate system to allow players to roll and to allow player wisdom to alter the outcome
> To navigate without getting lost:
> Plain = Check MOVE + [WIS+7] 
> Mountain, Hill, Forest = Check MOVE + [WIS-5]
> Desert, Jungle, Swamp = Check MOVE + [WIS-2]
