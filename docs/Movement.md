# Movement

> **MOVE** = 12 + DEX MOD - ENC.
>
> Party MOVE = lowest MOVE score.

Check MOVE to climb, jump, or flee.

Party movement rate is determined by the speed of the slowest member.

Moving at a fast pace prevents mapping. Characters aren't able to observe their environment as carefully. 

------

## Climbing

> Check **MOVE** to **climb**. 
>
> Add **1 ATR modifier per turn spent studying** the route. If a new segment is visible, do a second MOVE check.

Each exploration turn spent studying the climbing route will add one Attribute modifier from the player character's sheet to their MOVE.

Roll under the character's (adjusted) MOVE. 

If the roll fails, the referee should roll a D10 to see what percent is climbed before the fall.

------

A character with a MOVE of 12 and a Wisdom modifier of +2 could spend one turn to study the route. When they add their Wisdom modifier, the player will attempt to roll under 14 instead of under 12 to successfully complete the climb. 

## Dungeon Exploration

> **Exploration** = MOVE*10'.

A square on a dungeon map is usually 10'x10'. 

However, the referee (or a published adventure) may choose other measurements.

------

## Falling

> **1D6 damage per 10' fallen beyond first 10'**. 
> **Hanging** from a ledge **reduces** distance by **10**'. 
> **Intentional** falls result in a **DEX check** to **reduce** the calculated distance by **10'**.
> **50% chance of fragile items breaking**.

Every 10 feet fallen beyond the first 10 feet incurs 1d6 damage to the character. Hanging from a ledge reduces the calculated fall distance by 10 feet. Intentionally falling causes a Dexterity check; success reduces the calculated fall distance by 10 feet.

When the calculated fall distance is greater than 10 feet, there is a 50% chance of fragile items breaking, unless they are held in hand. Roll a D6 for each stored, fragile item. On a result of 1-3, the item will break.

## Movement in Encounters

> **Combat Round** = MOVE*10'รท3.
