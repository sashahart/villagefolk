## Disease

by Arnold K. Edited for brevity. [Original here](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/06/the-glog-diseases.html).

### Catching a Disease

Keep track every time a player is exposed to a disease: each bite from a dire rat, or each time they open a sarcophagus. You can also be exposed to a disease by touching a person who is infected, or spending too much time in close proximity.

The next morning, each character who was exposed must make a Con check. Multiple exposures incur cumulative penalties (-1 per subsequent exposure.) If they fail, they suffer the normal effects of the disease and are considered infected. It they pass, they suffer no effects and are not infected. 

### Suffering a Disease's Effects

Every subsequent morning, an infected character will make a Con check against the disease. If they fail this check, they take the listed ability score damage.

This damage will not recover naturally until the disease is cured. (Ability score damage is normally recovered at the rate of 1 point per ability score per day.)

If an ability score would be damaged below 0, all additional damage is redirected to Con. If Con ever reaches 0, the character dies. (0 Str / 0 Dex result in a character who is only capable of whispering and crawling. 0 Int / 0 Wis result in unconsciousness or a fevered delirium. 0 Cha results in the death of the soul.)

Diseases also have non-numeric effects, which are suffered as long as the character is infected.

### Recovering from Disease Naturally

If you succeed on two of these Con checks in a row, the disease is cured.

If you spent the entire previous day resting in bed, you get +2 on your morning Con check against the disease.

If you were also attended to by healers who used appropriate medicines, you get an additional +2 on your morning Con check. (This requires either an infirmary, or dubious herbs and an appropriate skill check.)

### Recovering from Disease via Exorcism

Casting *protection against evil *on a person gives them a new save against all ongoing diseases, with no penalty for failure.

If *protection against evil *is cast as part of an exorcism (and all priests and clerics know how to perform an exorcism), the save is made at a +2bonus. An exorcism ceremony takes an hour and requires an assistant. Using a vial of holy water (or its equivalent) confers another +2 bonus. If the Con check vs disease is a critical failure, all participants are exposed to the disease.

*Remove curse *instantly cures a disease, but is not a spell that players will ever be able to cast reliably.

### Recovering from Disease via Appeasement

Appeasing a disease spirit is very similar to paying a ransom.

The further the disease has progressed, the higher the ransom will be. Disease spirits are not inexperienced negotiators.

Each disease spirit is appeased by two different things. Roll 2d6 on the Appeasement Method Table to see what they are. If both dice show the same number, then the disease spirit is only appeased by that one thing. If the disease spirit receives that appeasement, it departs.

No actual amounts are listed for the appeasements, since the required offering depends on (a) how desperate the party is, and (b) how much they have to give. Disease spirits base their requirements on their evaluations of you.  For example, if you are dressed like rich nobles, then it will expect more money to be offered than if you were dressed like beggars (just like a regular ransom.)

And yes, clever players can sometimes use this to their advantage.

It is not obvious what methods will appease a particular disease spirit. A cleric can *commune *with the disease spirit and ask it a certain number of yes/no questions in order to ascertain what ransoms it will accept, and how much it expects. And of course, *speak with spirit *will allow you to speak with the disease spirit directly.

Alternatively, you could just try all six methods.

All appeasements must be accompanied by ceremony. This can be as simple as a few respectful words encoded in a prayer to the disease spirit, or simply ritualized begging over the afflicted person.

The appeasements listed below are general; feel free to make them more specific to particular diseases. For example, appeasing a bog pox spirit with money might involve throwing it into the swamp, while appeasing a leprosy spirit with money might involve binding a gold coin into a bubo. A sleeping sickness spirit might require you to put the money under the afflicted person's bed, where it vanishes as soon as it is unobserved.

#### Appeasement Method [d6, roll twice]

1            Blood            A worthy sacrifice.  Perhaps just a chicken if the disease is still 
in its early stages.  Terminal diseases require the sacrifice of a cow (100c) or a person.

2          Epidemic        You must consciously infect other people with your horrible disease.  
Perhaps just one other person if the disease is still in its early stages.  If the disease is 
terminal, a dozen is customary.

3            Flattery         Everyone must gather around and speak loudly about how great the 
disease spirit is, how powerful, and how generous.  Two successful Cha checks are required if the 
disease is in its  early stages, while as many as ten might be required if the disease is terminal. 
 Retries are only possible if the group of flatterers is at least twice as big as last time.  
Certain grandiose gestures (proposing to marry the disease spirit, offering it a knighthood) count 
as one or more automatic successes, but be aware that the disease spirit might actually accept 
these things (2-in-6 chance by default.)

4              Food           The salted herring and hardtack that passes for adventuring “rations” 
doesn't count.  Real food purchased from a real chef, or at least prepared with a skill check and a 
kitchen full of ingredients.  (Kitchens in dungeons are now relevant!)

5        Intoxicants     Perhaps just a bottle of whisky if the disease is still in its early 
stages.  If the disease is terminal, a box of opium (200c) is customary.

6            Money          Gold, silver, jewels, and items of exquisite craftsmanship of magical 
puissance.

- Remember that disease spirits are full NPCs. If the players start talking to them, you may want to roll up a random personality for them. And although they are intelligent, they lack a full understanding of human culture, and can be tricked. They might mistake a carved log for a human if it is wearing clothing, or they might not understand that a character is not actually a king, and has no standing to award knighthoods. You might even be able to fake a character's death well enough that the disease spirit will depart.

### Player Information

Please relay this information to players when they first contract a disease, so they can make informed decisions. Disease mechanics are an open system, not a hidden one.
