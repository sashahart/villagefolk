Impress 

Whenever you win a fight against challenging foes, people who don't like you make a new reaction roll with a +4 bonus. This even works on people you just defeated in combat, unless you caused them undeserved or disproportionate harm. Hirelings get a +2  to Morale, or a new Save vs Fear.

Cleave

### Who Are You?

You are a probably a member of the [Third Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm.) If you are good at fighting, it's seen as an affront and possibly a threat to the Second Estate. If you are literate, educated, or troublesome it's seen as a threat to the First Estate. In most places it's illegal for you to carry a sword. Your bow is used for hunting and practice. A strong body of archers is invaluable. Everything you do is taxed. You can expect no protection from the courts, no recognition under the law, and no chance of escaping your lot in life. You have a few rights, but they mostly relate to firewood and turnips.

Your lord typically has the right of "[pit ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning-pit)and [gallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dule_tree), [sake and soke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soke_(legal)), [toll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelony), [team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e), and [infangthief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infangthief_and_outfangthief.)". In modern English, "drowning, hanging, finding you, hunting you, charging you for movement or activity, requesting unpaid labour, and executing summary justice". All the linked articles are worth reading. In some circumstances it's illegal to move away from your land.

Permanent national armies don't exist. Armies are raised, fight, and retire when the season ends or the war is over. The only permanent military forces are [disorderly ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_company), as feared as the [plague ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-bring-out-your-dead.html)and nearly as devastating. While knights and lords obsess over warfare and honour, the involvement of the Third Estate is treated as a necessary but disreputable part of a war. Nevertheless, skilled fighting men can be found in any major city, willing to work for pay. They form a new career whose only profession is soldiering. Paying these soldiers requires more taxes.

You gain the skill listed, not the "Unusual" skill (which isn't a real skill anyway.)

2. A wizard trained you as a bet. He tutored you in combat while his noble patroness tutored a man in sewing, dancing, and poetry. He unsurprisingly lost the bet, but you remain on good terms. He gave you a random [minor magical trinket](http://www.occultesque.com/2017/05/1d100-magical-trinkets.html.) Gain the "Courtesy" skill.

4. You were taken as a squire by a [d4] 1. lecherous 2. extremely poor 3. extremely nearsighted, 4. eccentric low-status knight. He was recently killed in battle, and you feared that the persistent rumours would become questions and possibly a trial. Gain the "Horsemanship" skill.

6. You were raised in Foreign Parts, brought to Around Here as a captive or curiosity, earned your freedom, and now seek your fortune. You never liked Foreign Parts much anyway. You start with an appearance and native language so unusual that, to most people, your profession is the second most shocking thing about you. This could be extremely minor (hair colour, accent, pointed shoes.) (Yes, this still applies in a game with toadlings and wizards. At least they're *our *toadlings and wizards, not like those nasty foreign ones.) You gain the "Foreign Parts" skill. Make up 1d6 ludicrous lies.
