# Wizards

Starting Equipment: spellbook, ink, quill. Some schools may give additional items.

Starting Skill: see Backgrounds

A: +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +2 Spells (1-6), Spell Breeding 

B: +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +1 Spell (1-8), Book Casting 

C: +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot +1 Spell (1-10), Friendly Spell 

D: +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, Master of Magics 

You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Spell Slot for each Wizard template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each.

When you first gain a Wizard template, you must choose a school from the list below. You cannot change schools later.

As you level, you will gain spells from your school’s spell list. You still can learn and cast spells from outside your school, but until you cast them 8 times, MD spent on them only return on a 1, rather than a 1-3.

**Spell Breeding**
You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:
a) a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)
b) a random spell from a random spell list
c) a [mutant ](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/mutant-spells.html)version of one of the two spells

When the process is complete, Save or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus to Save for
a) every 1 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade
b) the number of Wizard templates you possess

c) each ritual preparation you describe to the GM
d) the number of times you'd previously cast the spells you are combining

**Book Casting**
You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. You must declare you are casting a spell from a book before initiatives are rolled for the turn. You automatically go last in the initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.

**Friendly Spell**
Choose 1 spell you know and have frequently cast. Apply a positive [mutation ](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/mutant-spells.html)to the spell. Do not roll on the drawbacks table, even if the mutation requests that you do.

**Master of Magics**

Learn up to 6 spells from your school’s spell list, or invent an entirely new spell (GM’s discretion.) 



### Chartered Wizards vs. Outlaw Wizards

Some schools of magic have royal charters. They are protected by law in many kingdoms. Their pedigree is established, their students (while raucous and troublesome), are predictable, and their utility in war or in peace is undeniable. However grudgingly, they are allowed a place in the[order of the world](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html.) Chartered schools also charge ruinous tuition, requiring the use of Wizard Student Loans.

Other schools of magic are outlawed. Biomancy and Necromancy are seen as perversions of the natural order. Holy texts and church doctrine state that wizards dabbling in the arts of twisting the body or raising the dead must be killed on sight. In practice, Creation is vast and the times are disordered. There are many places an outlawed wizard could hide.
There are some schools that are neither outlawed nor chartered. According to the law-makers they do not exist. These "Outsider" schools move through society's weave easily, because society has no hooks in them.
Once you have selected a school, roll on the corresponding Background table. You could easily say that your school is Chartered... in Foreign Parts, or that your wizard was trained by an outlawed wizard instead of a proper master. 

### Backgrounds

#### Chartered Wizard

You were trained at a college of wizards. When you weren't drinking, knife-fighting, fornicating, and skipping class, you learned a few spells. You have taken on Wizard Student Loans. You graduate owing 1d10x5000gp, unless your background states otherwise. You owe 1/500th of your total loan amount per month, payable in gold, new spells, magic item, intelligence, slaves, or dragon meat to your college. They will usually give you six months without payment before hunting you down and shaking you until you rattle.

1. You were a foundling, given to a chartered college as part of a town's ancient agreement. Your survival was unexpected but welcome. You start with the "History" skill and many useless facts. You took on a new name to reflect your school, such as "Peter Purplestripe" for Purplestripe College, or "Fredegund Tower" for the White Tower of Elderstone.
2. You are a child of a prosperous merchant. Your Wizard Student Loans are a mere 2,500gp. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill listed. Your parents are disappointed in you no matter what you do. 
3. Your village scraped together enough money to send you, the cleverest child in a dozen generations, to study. Start with the "Farmer" skill and a family. Expect [terrible letters from home](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2017/02/d100-terrible-letter-from-home.html.)
4. Your studies were progressing well, but you suffered a terrible setback. Gain a scar (see the Death and Dismemberment table) and a fear of some innocuous thing, such as lettuce, rain, beeswax, or mirrors. Start with the "Literature" skill. 
5. You have just - within a few days - agreed to become a War Wizard (or Wizard Ordinary.) Start with the "Literature" skill and 1d6 rumours about the [War](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-dont-you-know-theres-war-on.html.) 
6. A lord sponsored your studies. Your lord pays your wizard student loans as long as you work for him in whatever capacity he had planned. Start with the "History" skill.

#### Outsider Wizard

You exist on the edge of the law. While society has no fixed place for you, it does not actively seek your destruction. This is a minor distinction; for the purposes of the Estates, you are either an Outlaw, or a member of the [Third Estate](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html) who keep their abilities disguised.

1. You were tutored in a small group by a wise wizard. You know 1d4 other students from your school well enough that they'd answer your letters.Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill and item listed.
2. You were inducted into an ancient, secretive tradition. Start with the "Poisoner" or "Artist" skill, a dagger, and a secret handshake or sign.
3. You were exiled from your home for openly practicing your magical arts. Start with the "Farmer" skill and 2 rations.
4. You owe secret allegiance to a lord, and have served him in the past in matters best kept from the Chartered wizards. Start with the "Courtesy" skill and 5sp. 



1. You once offended a powerful bishop. Start with the "History" skill and a powerful enemy.
2. You somehow acquired a [camp follower](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/6hv3qi/1d100_table_of_camp_followers/.) You might have saved their life, or they might owe you for a past service, or  you might have caused some minor disaster in their life. Start with the "Soldier" skill or roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill listed.

#### Outlaw Wizard

1. You took up the forbidden arts to avenge some monstrous wrong. Roll at least once on [this table](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2016/02/d100-how-i-was-wronged-by-that-villain.html.) You care nothing for life or those who would judge you. Start with the "Frontier" skill and 5sp.
2. You willingly put your soul on the line while spellcasting. You may add +1 MD to any spell you cast, but you automatically generate a Mishap. This extra MD does not return to your pool. Start with the "History" skill.
3. No matter your abilities, you consider yourself a terrible wizard, a lousy fighter, and a bad friend. Start with the "Poetry" skill.
4. You left your master to face the mob and fled as the villagers lit the pyre. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill listed. You also start with 1gp and nightmares.
5. You experienced a terrible magical catastrophe. Start with the "Bandit" skill. You gain a +2 to Save vs Fear, but the survivors or victims of the catastrophe may still seek you.
6. You have a secret mission. You can choose to decide your mission's goal during character creation, or you can declare it at any time during play. If you succeed, you get 50 bonus XP and a deep sense of satisfaction. Start with the "Cultist" skill and a dagger.

### Mutant Spells

Spells are creatures, not techniques.  You cannot prepare three copies of one spell (unless you have three copies in your spellbook).  You do not learn spells, you lure them.  They are alive in every sense of the word.

They are like ethereal birds that nest in your spellbook, are loaded into your brain, are fired like a bullet, and then return to your spellbook before dawn.

And so it only make sense that there are species, carnivores, parasites, and mutants.  Let's talk about the mutants.

Whenever you find a random spell, roll a d100.  If the result is 1-20, it is a mutant and you should consult the Random Improvements Table below. 

You'll notice that the table actually goes up to 30, but the only way to get results 21-30 is through mutate spell.

### Random Improvements Table

1-2 Improved Effect.  The spell does more of whatever it does.  5d6 damage becomes 6d6, charm becomes obsession.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

3-4 Improved Range.  The range of the spell improves.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

5-6 Improved Area of Effect.  The spell affects a wider area, or more targets.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

7-8 Improved Duration.  The spell improves its duration.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

9-10 Improved Applicability.  The spell affects a broader category of targets.  Charm person becomes charm biped.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

11 Recyclable.  After being cast, the spell has a 50% chance of immediately returning to your brain.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

12 Petite.  The spell takes up a lower level slot.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

13 Elongate.  If the spell is successful, a weaker version will jump to an adjacent area or target.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

14 Facile.  You can cast the spell as a free action.  Roll on the Random Drawbacks Table.

15 Hard.  Targets get -4 to their Save.  Roll on the Drawbacks Table.

16 Subtle.  You can cast this spell quietly and without being noticed.  Roll on the Drawbacks Table.

17 Graceful.  You have more control over your spell.  You can create gaps in your fireball, for example.  Roll on the Drawbacks Table.

18-22 New Flavor.  The spell changes elements or orientations.  Fireball becomes lightningball, protection from evil becomes protection from good, charm person becomes charm bird (or perhaps infuriate person), web becomes freedom of movement.

23-24 Spellborn Homunculus.  Your spell becomes a person (read this).  They are neutral towards you.  Roll a random personality and goals.

25-26 Full Sentience.  Your spell becomes fully sentient.  It talks to you.  Roll a random starting personality and goals.  If it is angry at you, it may refuse to be cast.  If it is especially pleased, it may enhance itself in a way that you request.  Spells enjoy being in your brain and seeing out your eyes.  They do not enjoy being in the spellbook, which is much like a jail.  They may request (or plot) their release, or the release of all your spells.

27-28 Breeding.  Your spell has just given birth.  This newborn spell is a weaker version of its parent, but after being cast 5 times it will have grown to adulthood.  Roll a d100 to see if it has mutated from it's parent breed (the same as encountering a new spell in the wild).

29 Spell Fusion.  Your spell has fused with another spell in your head, rolled at random.  Fireball + cure light wounds becomes cureball (which is broken as all hell, but just roll with it).  Charm person + heat metal becomes charm fire (and once you befriend a fire, it will do favors for you).  Cure wounds + cause wounds becomes summon miniature black hole (because that's like dividing by zero or something).  If there is no other spell in your head to fuse with, your spell dies of loneliness.  The dead spell will linger in your head forever.  It will not take up a spell slot, but you will forever be aware of it rotting in there, like an opossum under your porch.

30 Fusion With You.  Your spell has fused with you, probably with your head.  You permanently lose access to that spell slot.  On the upside, you gain some thematic benefit.  Protection from evil might give you a small halo and immunity to possession, or it might invert and give you a ghoul claw complete with paralysis.  If the DM is unable to think of anything more interesting, then you can merely cast that spell 2/day.

### Random Drawbacks Table

1-2 Worsened Effect.  The spell does less of whatever it does.  5d6 damage becomes 4d6, charm becomes placate.

3-4 Worsened Range.  The range of the spell worsens.  A helpful spell with a range of 'touch' is reduced to 'self only'.  Reroll if this would reduce a damaging spell's range below 'touch'. 

5-6 Worsened Area of Effect.  The spell affects a smaller area, or fewer targets.  Reroll if this would reduce a spell to fewer than 1 target.

7-8 Worsened Duration.  The spell shortens its duration.  If the duration is instantaneous but creates a permanent effect (such as with knock or cure light wounds), the spell's effect becomes temporary.  For example, the door would relock itself and the wounds would reopen after 10 minutes.

9-10 Worsened Applicability.  The spell affects a narrower category of targets.  Charm person becomes charm man or charm dwarf.

11 Hungry.  The spell requires a unique reagent or focusing item.  This item always takes up an inventory slot.

12 Flaccid.  Targets get +4 to their save.

13 Dawdling.  The spell takes one round to go into effect.  For example, a magic missile that wanders around Family Circus-style before hitting its target.

14 Exhausting.  You are stunned for one round after casting this spell.

15 Maddening.  You take 1d4 Wis damage when you cast this spell.

16 Aneurysm.  You take 1d6 damage for every two levels of the spell.

17 Fat. The spell takes up a higher level slot.

18 Fussy.  The spell can only be cast under certain conditions (time of day, environment, etc).

19 Unreliable.  The spell has a 2-in-6 chance of fizzling.

20 Erratic.  The spell has a 1-in-6 chance of going off in a random direction or targeting a random target (including yourself).

### New Spell: Mutate Spell

Pick a spell that is in your brain, roll a d30, and consult the Random Improvements Table, above.

It might be better to give the players a couple potions of mutate spell, instead of a spell they can cast over and over again. 

And yet, some of these table results require some fast thinking on the DM's part.  What's a different flavor of knock anyway?

Here's what I recommend.  Make a list of as many options as you can in 10 seconds, and then roll one at random.

So, to use the knock example. . . knock is basically open door, so maybe open hand?  Or open mind?  Or open chest?  <rolls d3, gets a 2> The spell is open mind.  Maybe it's a bit of a stretch, but the spell can now cause close-minded people to reconsider a different viewpoint.  It allows for fresh reaction rolls or Charisma checks.
