# Procedure of Play

## Overland Turn

Overland turns are used when traveling over a distance.

1. The referee does maintenance (checks for light sources and other things altered by time.)
2. The party decides where to travel.
3. The referee determines whether the party becomes lost and determines weather, if deemed necessary.
4. The referee checks for wandering monsters or other encounters. 
5. The referee describes terrain and locations as players move through, allowing players to react and describing the results. If an encounter with a possibly hostile creature or person occurs, follow the encounter Procedure.

------

When checking for encounters, you may use a system presented to you in the module you're using, or you may use this simple system:

**Random Travel Encounters (d6)**

| 1       | 2            | 3          | 4       | 5-6     |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Monster | Monster Omen | Non-combat | Mundane | Nothing |

- Hunting.  Slows the party down a lot and costs some ammunition, but might yield a lot food.
- Foraging.  Slows the party down a little, but might yield modest amounts of food.
- Befriending NPCs.  Can raise their morale.  If you talk to an NPC all day and make a successful Charisma check, roll a d12.  If the result is higher than the NPC's current morale, it improves by 1.  Requires a tiny bit of roleplaying.
- Herbalizing.  Slows the party down a little, but might yield valuable medicines and antidotes.
- Just chatting with each other.  Awards a tiny amount of XP, like 10xp per day traveled in dangerous wilderness.  Requires a tiny bit of roleplaying.
- Scouting.  Slows the party down a litte, but gives them a chance to find a defensible/hidden place to spend the night.  Also gives a higher chance of finding hidden locations in the hex.

## Exploration Turn

Exploration turns are used in dungeons, cities, buildings, and so forth.

1. The referee does maintenance (check for wandering monsters or other encounters, light sources, and other things altered by time.)
2. Each PC describes their actions for one turn. (Each turn represents approximately ten minutes.)
3. The referee describes the results. If an encounter with creatures or persons of unknown disposition occurs, follow the encounter Procedure.
4. If the players decide to camp, roll
   1. Conflict
   2. Amity
   3. Domestic Bliss
   4. Snag
   5. Prowess
   6. Poor Health 

## Haven Turn

1 month **Haven Turns** may be spent on one downtime action per player. May only be taken to celebrate a safe return from an adventure. A lot of things should probably happen in the world during this time.
