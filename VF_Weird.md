## THE POSSESSING WEAPON

Empowered Weapon, Chariot

Harvest Soul

Spellcasting

Minions

**Empowered Weapon**

Medium weapon +1 ATK that dominates the wielder. Dominated creatures use their ability scores but save, attack bonus, etc is derived from the weapon. Dominated creatures have -2 to DEX and STR for the first 3 days.  Your hold on the creature ends when it is not touching you.  If a target makes their save against you, you cannot try again until tomorrow.

You can see and hear out of the blade, but you cannot speak except through the wielder.

**Chariot**

A person who willingly joins with you becomes your "chariot".  Coercion does not work. Make a deal.

- Your chariot reduces all fire damage taken by the HD of the highest HD religious "good" character (angel, paladin, or cleric) you've ever killed. 
- At any time, you can choose to deal 1d6 to your chariot in order to deal an additional +1d6 on a hit.



**Harvest Soul**

You can drain the soul from a recently killed enemy.  This takes a standard action and requires you to impale the corpse with your demon blade within 1 round of the corpse's death.

Your wielder heals 1d6 HP, plus 1 HP for every HD of the target.

The target's soul is trapped in the demon blade.  The demon blade can hold up to 3 souls.  Trapped souls can see and hear from inside the demon blade.

You can speak with souls trapped in the demon blade (and it may be difficult to get them to shut up.) They are generally unhelpful but can become helpful if you do favors for them, fight against a mutual enemy, or entertain them.

**Spellcasting**

Beginning at level 3, you learn a new spell every level (your choice from the list), and a random spell every time you kill a dungeon boss. 

Spells are powered by souls trapped in the demon blade.  You must have sufficient trapped souls to cast a spell.  The 'X' in the spell description, refers to the HD of the trapped soul.  You use a soul in its entirety--no half-spent souls.

**Minions**

A bunch of demons show up to pledge their loyalty to you.  3d20 lemures, 1d4 bone devils, and 1d4 succubi.  They will expect you to lead a crusade back into hell, to reconquer it from the paladins.

**Demon Blade Spells**

1. Burning Blade
   R: 0   T: self (blade)  D: 10 minutes
   The demon blade does an additional +X dacaster on a hit.

5. Disguise
   R: 0  T: self  D: X hr
   You appear as someone else of comparable size.  This is only an illusion, but it also changes your voice to match.  (If you are playing with *detect evil*, I suppose it can fool that, too.)
6. Heartripper
   R: 20'   T: creature
   If a creature has Xd6 HP or less, it's heart is ripped out of its chest and into your hand.  No save.  This is usually fatal.  No effect on creatures that lack hearts.

   Free action when the demon blade does melee dacaster.  Deal +Xd6 dacaster.
10. Salvage the Chariot

## Really Good Dog

You gain +1 HP and +1 Initiative for every Really Good Dog template you possess.
Starting Equipment: collar, f leas
Starting Skill [d3]: 1 = Hunting Dog, 2 = Stray Dog, 3 = Show Dog

A Dog, Best Friends, +1 Attack
B Lick, Wag
C Sniff, Growl, +1 Attack
D Takedown, Epic Nose

**Dog**
Your Movement is 15, but you lack hands and cannot climb ropes. Your fur coat gives you Defense +3 as if it were armor, but takes up no Inventory Slots. You have half as many Inventory Slots as usual. Your bite deals 1d6+Str damage and is a Light Weapon. You can recognize scents. You can “talk” freely with people who have known you a long time (other PCs), but are otherwise limited to doggy communication. You are fluent in Canine.

You roll you Intelligence score normally, but be aware that this is doggy intelligence. You'll never be able to do calculus, but you can notice the seams of a trap or spot a counterfeit coin.

**Best Friends**
Pick another PC to be your best friend. Whenever you are both adjacent to each other, you both get +2 on all d20 rolls that you make at the same time, against the same thing.

**Lick**
If your best friend is Dying, you can lick their face to restore 1 HP. If your best friend is ever out of control (paralyzed, mind-controlled, raging, etc) you can nip them to give them a new save against the effect.

**Wag**
When you wag your tail, humanoid children of all species must save as if vs charm person.

**Sniff**
As detect evil and detect magic except range is 3”.

**Growl**
A single enemy must Save vs Fear or be unable to attack or approach you for one turn. Doesn't work ifyou are non-threatening. Growling is a standard
action.

**Takedown**
Whenever you bite an opponent and get a 2 or a 3 on the Attack Roll, you may make a Str check opposed by your targets Str or Dex (whichever is higher). If you succeed, you trip your target.

**Epic Nose**
If you spend a minute sniffing a creature, you can learn a terrific amount of things about it. You learn the answers to 1 question about the creature's habits (e.g. “Does it work for the druid?”, “What dungeon level is it from?”). If it is possible to follow a trail by scent, you can follow that trail by scent.

**Dog Quest**
At some point in your career, you will attract the attention of the Dog Barons, who will give you a quest to prove your doggishness. Example quests include killing a Cat Prince (rakshasa) who is hiding in town somewhere, digging into a forgotten barrow and returning with the femur from the wight king who was buried there, or rescuing some asshole prince who fell down a well in orcish territory. (This will
probably involve the other PCs chasing after you shouting "Where are you going, boy? Come back!") If you refuse or fail this quest, you will be shunned by the Dog Clans of the cities. If you succeed, you will win allies among the Dog Clans, and can call on their help in the cities. 

Examples of help: gossip, relaying messages, safe houses, and/or the assistance of a pack of mangy street dogs.
